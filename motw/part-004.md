# Dealing with the vamps in the theatre

Samuel's spell works and the rope wraps itself around the man in the gods of the theatre, but that's the last we here of Samuel. The man is now tied up, but also tied to the vampire he was trying to lower to the stage with the rope, they are both hanging from the same rope over the same scaffold pole in the gods of the theatre.
The shot from Sean's express rifle clips the man on the stage in the shoulder, he's wounded and begins to turn into what looks like a werewolf, head and paws first, but still looks ready to fight. George bamfs onto the stage and attempts, successfully, to behead him with his flaming sword but is injured in the process. With him out of the way, apart from the pile of remains and the pool of blood, Sean tries to repeat his shot on the rope holding the vampire and the werewolf, he misses and hitting the other werewolf in the thigh, who screams out in pain.

George has a better idea and bamfs up to the gods, he yells catch to those below as he cuts the rope holding both vampire and werewolf letting the werewolf fall as he clings onto the vampire. Below Sean assisted by Gabriel catch the vampire, they mess up and Sean ends up sprawled on the stage covered in blood as he slips over in it. While the fall knocked out werewolf two, they use rope to tie up the vampire. As the werewolf comes to screaming in agony from the gunshot wound in his thigh, there is a tense conversation, a little bit of bargaining and yes some torture before, the poor creature gives up his information in exchange for George's proffered healing. He says he was sent to get the alpha vampire and it will be delivered to someone but he can't say who. Sean has a chance to grab a slip of paper hanging out of his pocket before he sezies his chance and legs it. Kyle who has appeared by this time having stayed to guard the carriage puts a knife in his back which he will probably never see again.

George continues his violence by beheading the prostrate alpha vampire, this causes the other vampires hanging unrestrained in the gods to shake off the last of the tranquiliser and scream out at the loss of their sire. Unrestrained as they are they all charge George. One is picked off by Gabriel and his stake firing shotgun, Sean and Kyle both sucessfully drag vampires off George, but he takes some harm from the remaining one and it looks quite unstable. Gabriel reloads and despatches a second vampire. The last two disengage from the fight and run off, fast. Throughout the fight Gabriel is seen to be taking samples of blood and other things, both of the werewolves and his own comrade George.

There is a discussion about how to get the blood covered Sean back to The Ambers, given that Kyle has informed them that due to his climbing out and looking away the carriage they all came in has been pinched. They settle on a plan to scrape/rub off most of the blood, remove Sean's trousers, find a small red cloak from the theatre costumes and cover his legs with Kyle's shirt sleeves. Kyle dons a white robe thinking he can appear to be the Dr of a mad man. George bamfs back to The Ambers for some first aid and Gabriel is quick to find a hackney carriage, warning him ahead of time about the other passengers. The driver thinks something weird is going on and decides to head for Scotland Yard. When they notice this they try to stop the carriage, it takes a couple of tries to do this. Gabriel dismounts quickly and heads off on his own back to The Ambers? The other two remonstrate with the driver before making their way back, uneventfully in the end, on foot.

Kyle and Sean arrive back at The Ambers, but Gabriel is no where to be seen. Those that need it get some first aid and stiff drinks. When Gabriel finally come in he writes up his report and other paperwork and goes to see Clerkonwell. They have a discussion about the nights events and the possible reinstatement of their tab. Clerkonwell tasks them with working out why the dogs didn't kill the vamps and what the hell they might want with one. Gabriel asks for someone to go watch The Old Slaughterhouse in Milwall overnight and Clerkonwell agrees and heads off to dispatch someone, who will report back in the morning.

Meeting up in the dining room, Sean examines the piece of paper and reads...

To Victor Darkholm,
Fetch me an alpha vampire from The Nocture Palace Theatre, I will send instructions for where to deliver it when I know you have been successful.
Your sincerly
Octavian Frostholm

A quick bit if research and asking questions doesn't yeild any clues as to who this Octavian might be.

Our tired hunters head off for some rest overnight in order to further heal their wounds. After breakfast in the morning, and Gabriel and George head off to Cleronwell's office to get an update on the overnight stakeout (pun intended) It seems there are at least 10 werewolves, if they are all werewolves, coming and going from the slaughterhouse. The injured one is seen to come back and there is an obvious attempt at communication when another is sent off with a letter in a carriage. It seems after the injured werewolf returns they have upped security on the place, almost like they are expecting trouble.

## Questions
Who is Octavian Frostholm?
What might he want with a live (well sort of) alpha vampire?
What are the werewolves on the Isle of Dogs afraid of?
Is it time to pay a visit to the reporter Vanessa Waverly to see if she can shed some light on any of these questions?
Is there going to be a war between dogs and vamps?
