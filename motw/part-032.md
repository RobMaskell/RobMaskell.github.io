# A Victorian Chronicle of the aftermath of the night before

December 21th 1896 - Dawn

*Being a faithful account of the extraordinary adventures of a most peculiar band of gentlemen*

## Chapter I: Of Reunions Most Unwelcome
The dawn of this most eventful day found our intrepid band scattered across the battlefield of their previous encounter, having witnessed scenes of violence that would test the resolve of lesser men. The ancient scholar Samuel Fitzwilliam, now existing in his spectral form, had been separated from his companions by the mystical tethering to his quill case - a bond that drew him through solid walls with considerable discomfort when young Kyle and the pyrotechnically-inclined Sean departed in their carriage.

"Oh, fuck. Sean, we need to get out of here now," declared Kyle with characteristic urgency upon witnessing a familiar figure emerging from the house of recent combat. The lady in question was none other than Patricia, his former spouse, who had undergone a most alarming transformation since their matrimonial dissolution. She now possessed abilities that defied natural law, manifesting before their carriage in a manner most supernatural.

The Foundation operative Gabriel West and the angelic warrior George Banks remained within the residence, where Novilium Black - Gabriel's superior in that clandestine organisation - delivered stern reproach regarding the compromised state of their entire institution. The demonic entity known as C-12 had indeed proven to be Patricia herself, possessed by forces most malevolent.

"Now, young Gabriel," declared Novilium with the authority of one accustomed to command, "now that the initial danger has passed, we need to have a conversation about how this could have been prevented." The critique fell heavily upon Gabriel's shoulders, though the divine George Banks proved most vigorous in his friend's defence, declaring with righteous indignation: "This chap who stands before you has done more good for this world than you will know. So I strongly suggest you take back what you've just said and damn with your foundation."

## Chapter II: Domestic Negotiations of an Infernal Nature
Meanwhile, within the confines of the horse-drawn conveyance, Kyle found himself engaged in most delicate negotiations with his former bride. Patricia, now housing the demon C-12 within her mortal form, had appeared with declarations of affection most inconvenient to their current circumstances.

"You drove off, my love," she observed with that peculiar mixture of longing and menace that characterises the romantically possessed.
Kyle, demonstrating admirable quick thinking despite his corpulent frame, attempted to deflect with claims of urgent medical appointments: "We've got a really important appointment to go to. My friend here has a Lombargo, and we need to get to the doctors immediately."

The scholarly Samuel, observing these proceedings with growing alarm, communicated telepathically his assessment of the situation - that Patricia was indeed possessed by an extremely powerful demon. Kyle's response, delivered with typical sardonic wit, was simply: "She has been for years."

Through a combination of Kyle's dubious charm and Sean's enthusiastic if somewhat confused assistance, they managed to arrange a meeting. Patricia agreed to introduce Kyle to her "powerful friends" at a location of their choosing - specifically, a bookshop near the Amber Society headquarters. The kiss she bestowed upon Kyle's cheek before her departure caused the unfortunate fellow to immediately expel his stomach's contents over the side of the carriage.

## Chapter III: Medical Interventions and Supernatural Solutions
Back at the residence, practical matters demanded attention. Gabriel, his hands fused within makeshift plastic mittens containing shards of glass, required urgent liberation from his self-imposed bonds. George Banks, wielding his divine sword Arceus, undertook this delicate operation with mixed results. The first attempt, using the sword in its concealed cane form, succeeded in freeing one hand but destroyed the weapon's scabbard in the process.

"Hold still, dear boy," George instructed with admirable sang-froid, "but if you sneeze, it could be the end." The second attempt, employing the flaming blade itself, proved more successful, melting away the plastic prison with surgical precision.

Upon reuniting with their companions at a coaching inn, Kyle's bullet wound required attention. Gabriel's attempt at field medicine proved somewhat less than expert, causing additional harm in his efforts to extract the projectile. This necessitated the intervention of Samuel Fitzwilliam, who employed his spectral abilities to perform a most unusual healing ritual.

"This is exceptionally painful," Samuel warned, describing a process that involved inserting ghostly fingers directly into the wound. The procedure, while effective in healing the damage, left Kyle with scarring that would provide conversational material for years to come.

## Chapter IV: Aerial Combat and Strategic Planning
Their respite was interrupted by the arrival of six corvids - agents of the enemy, as Kyle's expertise confirmed. George Banks rose to this challenge with characteristic celestial flair, summoning forth a divine eagle of magnificent proportions. The creature, described as possessing "pure white, like a golden beak" with "golden and silver lattice threads run through his wings," engaged the hostile birds in aerial combat of epic proportions.

The battle proved swift and decisive. The holy eagle dispatched several crows with brutal efficiency before the survivors recognised their hopeless position and fled. The creature then demonstrated its gratitude by presenting Hubert, George's snowy owl companion, with a fresh mouse before taking up residence atop the inn.

Hubert, returning from his own reconnaissance mission, reported that the assault upon the Amber Society had mysteriously ceased some twenty minutes prior - timing that coincided perfectly with their encounter with C-12/Patricia. This intelligence suggested either that their possession of the tablet had been discovered, or that Kyle's romantic entanglement had somehow influenced their enemies' strategy.

## Chapter V: The Forging of Desperate Plans
As the morning progressed, our heroes found themselves confronting the stark reality of their situation. The demon-killing dagger, their most potent weapon against the forces of darkness, could only be wielded by Kyle - the very gentleman whose physical condition and emotional entanglements made him perhaps the least suitable warrior among their number.

George Banks proposed an ingenious solution: "Make the fake tablet. We find a way with our combined magic... I wonder if we could impart the power of the dagger into the fake tablet. So as to when they try and use it for the summoning, it takes them all down."

This stratagem would require considerable magical preparation and research, necessitating a return to the Amber Society's libraries. The plan carried significant risks - not least that Patricia might appear at any moment, drawn by her supernatural connection to Kyle.

Gabriel, ever practical, posed the crucial question to their reluctant hero: "Are you comfortable holding the entire fate of the world in your very hands? Every child, every person?"

Kyle's response, while characteristic in its self-serving nature, demonstrated an unexpected acceptance of responsibility: "If the way forward is, you know, sacrificing your lives so I can be the triumphant hero, then I guess that is something I'm willing to do for you."

## Chapter VI: The Path Forward
As midday approached, our band of supernatural investigators found themselves committed to a course of action fraught with peril. They would return to the Amber Society to research the complex magical ritual required to imbue the false tablet with the demon-slaying properties of Kyle's blade. The genuine tablet would remain hidden, while Kyle himself would be kept at a safe distance to prevent Patricia from disrupting their preparations.

The weight of the world's salvation now rested upon the shoulders of perhaps the most unlikely hero in all of London - an overweight legal expert with a fondness for bacon and an unfortunate history of complicated romantic relationships. Yet in these dark times, when conventional heroes had failed, perhaps only such an unconventional champion could succeed where others had fallen short.

With their course determined and the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, our intrepid investigators prepared for what might well prove to be their final chapter in this most extraordinary of adventures.

# Questions for the Next Session:
* Will Kyle manage to resist Patricia's charms, or will he accidentally end the world while trying to rekindle their romance?
* Will Gabriel's medical skills improve, or should the party invest in actual medical insurance for Kyle?
* How many more of Kyle's ex-wives will turn out to be world-ending demons, and does he have a type?
* Can Samuel perform surgery while incorporeal, or will all future medical procedures sound like Victorian horror novels?
* Will the fake tablet plan work, or will they accidentally hand over the real one because nobody remembered which was which?
* Will Hubert and the eagle form a crime-fighting duo, or are they destined to compete over George's attention?
* Can the party complete a single plan without something catching fire, courtesy of Sean's pyromania?
