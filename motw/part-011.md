# Meet the big bad

A tall man with long dark hair reveals himself to our plucky heroes. He starts the traditional BBEG monologue asking who he is talking to. Sean claims to be called Bob, Kyle claims to be called Sean. He tells them his name is Octavian Frostholm and appears to be left handed. Asking Sean to come in from his tree and for the rest, minus Samuel, to sit down, Octavian offers them tea and biscuits which his demon goons dutifully fetch. Kyle makes a start on the biscuits, and demolishes all but one of them without breaking a sweat.

Gabriel's friends from The Foundation, use an unseen fire escape to climb up to the room George is trapped in. They break the circle having suggested he stay silent. The three of them pile down the stairs and take out a couple of demon goons. Octavian has had enough and leaves by vanishing, his goons then leave too. The group pick up their weapons from the floor and under the tree and head back to the carriage. Edmund and Barty nearly break Gabriel's cover in the aftermath of the confrontation, Gabriel considers reporting them for that. George suggests they should have a further word with the reporter.

On arriving back at the carriage, there are visible signs of a struggle and the the driver is gone. Searching for the missing driver, they find he has been dragged off by more demons and go after him following the clear trail. Samuel force pushes a demon onto a broken off tree branch and Kyle dispatches them with his Katana. George arrives and lays on hands to try and heal the driver. Once he's stabilised they carry him back to the carriage but he's in no state to drive. George gives him a shot of whisky for medicinal purposes and heals himself. Gabriel offers to drive, and they head back to the village of Oxley, the passengers think that Gabriel hits every pot hole on the way. The driver now conscious is very apologetic. Later in the inn, Gabriel heads off and buys a whisky and sits on his own drinking it. George is last in, looking pensive and ill also buys whisky.

Sleeping arrangements are Sean and George in one room and Gabriel and Kyle in the other. Not that Samuel or George sleep that much.

Edmund and Barty, Gabriel's Foundation tail are outside the pub drinking beers and looking to blend in.

In the morning there is a discussion at breakfast...
* need to research demons, try to find his real name?
* use the land registry to find out who owns Appledore?
* if Frostholm a demon or is he just possessed?
* how to un-vessel a demon such that it doesn't kill the vessel?

Kyle dips into his dark past and remembers he knows a women who works at the British Museum, Isadora Featherstone, and he thinks he can pump her for information even though their previous relationship ended badly. Kyles fault obviously.

After breakfast, George, Gabriel and Kyle head off to the school. It has outdoor sports facilities and a message from Samuel carved into one of the old desks. The emblem of the school is the Frostholm snake eating itself, with the latin motto beneath that translates as "No cost too high". They meet Alistair Copperfield the school master who tells them a bit about the school and that Frostholm has two children.

Sean takes a walk, on his own, or at least with Samuel in his pocket. He sees the school, the tent, that the carriage has been broken into. He sees Edmund and Barty and is heading over to talk to them, when as he passes an alley he feels a prick in his calf and very quickly collapses. He wakes up to the ministrations of the guys and they realise Samuel's quill case has gone....
