A weekend passes, the group spend their time...

- Sean, Takes a train to the forest cabin, bit of fishing
- George, Visits Winchester Cathedral, speaks with the powers up top
Back in lounge of the Ambers Society they discuss bacon and Samuels aversion to salt. They decide to try and find the book and then head to kent.

George and Gabriels head off to see a contact on a bookshop George knows... "Fobiles Fantastic Emporiam for Nik Naks and the Occult" It's a run down place with a pub sign, bay windows, shabby curtains, double doors, a bell that rings when the door opens. There are stuffed animals on piles of books, it's very weird. There is a small man behind the counter wearing a Fez, on the counter there are books and rabbits feet. His name is Silas Dunmore. There is a beaded off area at the back, purple and white beads and seating areas. The owner clearly lives there.

The talk of the Pricipia Magica, Silas tells them there are two known copies, one of wich sold to a private buyer 3 months ago.

They also strike a bargain to look at "Occultia of Southern England" to see if there are any places in Kent that look interesting.

After a lot of talk they give Slias the name of the spell and he thinks that it's probably a ritual for summoning a great old one and could be biblically bad. Gabriel uses his luck, so is expecting red tape on his next mission.

They end the conversation with Silas by telling him to stay out of it because the more they talk the more they get the impression that he is interested. Silas gets annoyed at this, which is strange.

Sean, Kyle and Samuel head off to the British Library (again) to try see if they have a copy of the Principia that they can get a look at. Ky;e gets a bag of warm chestnuts and can be heard snuffling like a pig. Their angle is that they are reporters foir The Times doing an article on a series of societies of London. They start at the main desk talking to Lucinda (a basic librarian) and she wants to send the issue upstairs to Jasper Emberwick the chief librarian as he handles such matters. They discuss the matter with Jasper and while convincing him he drops The Order of the Veiled Dawn to see if that is one of the societies they are planning to report on. He says he is investigating them to try and get a book back that was stolen.

He agres that they can have a look at the books introduction IF the library has a copy. He takes them down to a secure reading room on the level below the main reading room, he locks them in and disapopears. Sean and Kyle start to try and work out how to escape. Eventually after Jasper has been to the vault and spoken with the vault guardian he return with the book. While casually looking at the book, they sheild it from Jasper who sits in the corner and Samuel pops out of his case into the wall poking his head out the read, whist remaining hidden from Jasper.

Jasper spots them anyway, and tries to run for help, Sean gets to the door at the same time as Jasper and gets his knee on it. Kyle bundles Jasper to the floor. They subdue him and leaving the book make a run for it, which is tricky for Kyle.

When they arrive back at the club, with Kyle wheezing like an an old squeeze box. They meet up with George and Gabriel back from their trip to the bookshop and compare notes:
* Spell to summon a great old one, could be biblically bad
* Octavian will need the name of the great old one he wants to summon
* Plus:
* * a 500+ carat diamond
* * blood of an alpha vampire
* * Egyption tablet of the dead
* * casting time will be 12 hours

Our heros assume that he has the vamp blood, based on the coffin shaped box, but this is unconfirmed.

## Questions
* Who bought the book?
* How many of the items might Octavian already have?
* Is Silas the book shop owner friend or foe?
* Is the British Library out to get the Order?
* Did anyone follow them back to HQ?
* What will the red tape Gabriel suffers in the next mission consist of?
* Can he trust The Foundation?
* Where the fuck is Kent?
