# Fire in the hole

December 18th 1896 - Afternoon

Kyle is seen to become quite visibly unsteady on his feet and slowly slumps to the floor up against a bookcase. He's out of action.

Samuel asks Gabriel to enter the shop, which he does and surveys the scene... Kyle down, dagger in Silas' hand, neck slit. Although if you ask Sean, Silas slit his own neck on Sean's knife. Gabriel asks if anyone has died and also asks Samuel and Sean what they think they are doing. Gabriel renews his acquaintance with Silas as they are known to each other, and Gabriel sets to work on Silas with a first aid kit in order to stabilise him. Urged on Silas writes the name of the cult that Frostholm belongs to on the paper, which Sean pockets.

They are disturbed by a sound from above, what appears to be an Imp like creature with more joints in his arms and legs than required, sat above them on the wooden chandelier, they appear to be unscrewing it from the ceiling. Gabriel asks the Imp what it thinks it is doing? The Imp appraises them, smiles and disappears. As they do so, the metal shutters of the shop can be heard coming down and light in the shop is cut down significantly.

The response is "Take his hand off". Silas is now sitting in a chair near Sean being attended by Gabriel and his first aid kit. Sean has his hand on Silas' shoulders. Silas slashes out with the dagger stuck to his hand, it's not in the right position so he makes a meal of it and Sean smacks him in the head. Enough of a hit to potentially cause a concussion later. Gabriel tosses a tourniquet to Sean and tells him to strap it onto Silas' arm, because he's going to take the hand off. Sean attaches the tourniquet and also knocks Silas out with a large book, he's not a monster after all.

Samuel is dealing with the fact that they appear to be locked into the shop, he figures the way out will probably be up or down, he tries up. Floating through the ceiling he see what appears to be the upstairs flat of the shop. There is an old lady sitting in a chair reading. The windows look open up here but Samuel can't see any obvious way up. Drifting out the back of the building he sees fire escape style steps up to the ground and first floors. He also notices that the shop shutters are padlocked.

Back in the shop, books start flying off the shelves at the group, Sean tries to protect himself but takes one in the back, Kyle also takes one on the body as no one tries to protect him. Gabriel has had enough though and takes his shotgun and tries to blow Silas' wrist off. Unluckily Gabriel had salt cartridges loaded from before so all he manages to do it blow the flesh off the wrist exposing the bone. Silas wakes up and cries out in pain. Looking around the shop the group see other more dangerous items than books, ceremonial daggers for instance, they decide to ignore them for now and concentrate on the job at hand (no pun intended). Gabriel reloads and then blows Silas' hand off at the wrist, he immediately passes out from the pain and is losing blood despite the tourniquet. They add a second tourniquet to try and stem the bleeding. Gabriel knows he needs to secure the dagger and with Kyle still down and his fate unknown he decides the best plan is to try and magic the dagger back to the order's headquarters using a vial of Georges blood in an attempt to copy the bamfs he often sees from George. He is lucky and it works.

George sitting in the infirmary is very surprised that a bloody pile of rags appears suddenly in his lap. He unwraps the package to find the Ravenshade dagger and a man's hand blown off at the wrist. He put the grizzly spectacle in a large steel kidney shaped bowl. He asks the nurse to go and get Clerkonwell and while he's waiting for him he surmises (correctly) that things aren't going smoothly at the shop.

In the shop there is surprise at Gabriel's magic, both that he performed it and that it worked...! Sean thinking that the Imp and the store owner Silas are in cahoots, picks up a book and sets fire to it in order to try and make Silas control the Imp and prevent him bothering the crew. Unfortunately Sean makes a couple of errors here, one that Silas has the bandwidth to care any more and second that the Imp is working with him and not against him.

Gabriel gets back on the first aid, and tries to stabilise Silas doping him up with opium. The ceremonial daggers the crew noticed earlier now start flying around and there are cuts a plenty. Kyle still lacking any real support from the rest and now fully passed out takes one in the leg, it's not a serious wound but you think questions will be asked if and when Kyle regains conciousness. It's just not cricket to leave a man down.

The fire that Sean started when he set the book on fire and then threw it casually to the floor is now engulfing the bookcase it came to rest against. With this push to action Samuel heads out the back wall to see what he can do about an exit for the lads. He tries to use magic to explode the padlock on the metal shutter over the back door. He gets lucky and even though it had no right to work somehow it does and the lock rapidly dissembles into shrapnel. Samuel suggest they should leave, soon.

Gabriel tries to move Silas towards the back door. Sean looks around for things to take and spots the “Occultia of Southern England”. Sean also spots Kyle and loading him onto a handy book trolley starts wheeling him towards the back door. At the backdoor the attempts to open it fail when it's discovered that it opens outward into the shutters.

George is still sitting in his bed in the infirmary contemplating the arrival of the bloody stump when Clerkonwell walks in. They discuss the slaughter house and the fight between the werewolves and the vampires. George let's Clerkonwell in on Syrus being hidden under the floor grate. They also discuss the potential situation at the shop as Clerkonwell asks if that thing in the bowl is THE dagger?

Back at the shop, the flames are now taking over and smoke is starting to become a problem. Gabriel rips the door off it's hinges and opens the shutter. Anyone watching would notice that since the shutters came down Gabriel has been different, cold, calculating and ruthlessly focussed on his goal. Everyone makes it out, Kyle is nearly thrown down the stairs by Sean off the trolley but he decides not to at the last minute. They group up in the yard out the back of the shop. Gabriel heads off to raise the alarm on the fire, these things can easily get out of hand. While he's gone Sean finally takes a look at the dagger protruding from Kyles leg, looking to compact the wound and slow the blood loss.

George wings into Kyle at this point and a discussion is had as to what has gone on, why the hand, why is everything on fire?. Samuel tries to use magic to literally use wisps of himself to patch the vein with a weave. It means he can't hide any more and will have to stay close to Kyle until medical facilities are found. Gabriel returns and there is a discussion about the women upstairs and why no one had gone to get her. Gabriel goes to rescue the woman but in the process steps too close to some shaky floorboards and cave in. George rescues Gabriel using wings and is lucky to be able to bamf back to the group.

Everyone makes it to the carriage, in the chaos surrounding the burning buildings no one notices Samuel. They leave the elderly lady with the newly arrived fire brigade but take everyone else. As they are leaving the scene in the coach, they spot the Imp slightly more solid looking heading off down the road. They are heading back to the Ambers Society to re-group. They have managed to find the name of the cult but it has come at a large cost. Gabriel blames Sean for everything and says it will all be in his report.
