# Upon the fashioning of a deceptive tablet for the confounding and banishment of dæmonic forces
*Being a most comprehensive account of intelligence gathered at considerable expense, pertaining to a ritualistic procedure whereby one may construct a counterfeit tablet of such cunning Design as to mislead the infernal legions into believing it the genuine article, and which shall, upon activation, produce a most violent detonation sufficient to return said entities unto their nether realms of origin.*

## The grand design of the artifice
The fundamental principle underlying this most audacious scheme doth involve the creation of a simulacrum tablet, upon which shall be inscribed the identical text as appeareth upon the original. This counterfeit must then be imbued with the dæmon-slaying virtue inherent within the sacred dagger, achieved through the melting of said blade's metal and its mystical infusion into the very stone itself, such that upon detonation it shall act as most deadly shrapnel. Furthermore, one must incorporate the thaumaturgical explosive properties of that most Holy Armament known as the Hand Grenade of Antioch, which shall provide the necessary concussive force to disperse the aforementioned shrapnel with maximum efficacy.

## Upon the delicate matter of fusion without diminution of potency
A method must needs be discovered whereby these disparate elements may be melted and fused together whilst preserving intact their most potent magical essences, for ordinary fire alone shall prove insufficient to this purpose, being liable to dissipate the very magical virtues we seek to concentrate. Our investigations lead us to propose that the corrosive ichor of the Lindworm may serve admirably in this capacity, providing the necessary alchemical medium for fusion without the deleterious effects of common flame.

## Concerning the vital necessity of concealment
The completed tablet must not, under any circumstances, betray to the discerning observer the presence of explosive or dæmon-destroying energies contained therein. We hold it as our firmest conviction that the optimal stratagem for accomplishing this obfuscation doth lie in procuring, through whatever means may present themselves, a sufficient quantity of that most terrible substance known as "Essence of Evil," and imbuing the tablet therewith simultaneously with the infusion of the dagger and grenade elements.
Whilst we cannot claim absolute certainty as to the success of this approach, our reasoning doth suggest that the tablet, when subjected to close scrutiny, should emanate a powerful magical resonance, yet the evil radiating from its very substance ought to mask and obscure the other forms of enchantment held within its stone, thereby, we hope most fervently, preventing any further investigation that might reveal its true nature.

## The incantation of activation
Due to our employment of the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch in this great working, there existeth one matter of which we may speak with complete assurance: The detonation must be triggered by means of a person reciting aloud the Incantation of Incineration, a brief verbal formula which doth amount, in its essence, to the simple counting unto the number three. This recitation must occur within the auditory range of the tablet for the mechanism to function as designed.
It is most strenuously advised that one should NOT count beyond the sacred number three.

## Intelligence pertaining to the Lindworm
*Being notes upon the nature and habits of this most formidable serpentine beast*
* Most frequently encountered in the depths of ancient woodland domains
* The ichor of its veins is known to possess corrosive properties of a most violent nature; handle with extreme caution and avoid all contact
* Its breath and saliva do likewise exhibit corrosive qualities, though somewhat less virulent than the blood proper; nevertheless, avoid all contact
* Of prodigious size and strength, capable of constricting its prey unto death through the crushing power of its coils
* Suspected of accumulating hoards of treasure in its lair
* Possessed of remarkable celerity in movement, the precise mechanism of which remaineth uncertain to our Understanding
* Demonstrated imperviousness to certain forms of attack
* Possessed of sentience and, in some accounts, the faculty of speech
* No weakness of a reliable nature hath yet been identified

*A notation in Hand:* The nearest expansive ancient woodland of suitable character: Epping Forest, situated in the North-Eastern environs of London?

## Upon the procurement of Essence of Evil
*Being Counsel most Grave regarding this Perilous Undertaking*
The acquisition of this substance would constitute an endeavour of the most torturous and arduous nature, and may indeed prove impractical given the constraints of time under which we labour. We therefore recommend most earnestly that you seek out one Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, who, together with his newly constituted Organisation styling itself "The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn," may possess this required element as part of their practice of Occult Rituals and Ceremonial Workings.

**A word of caution:** Exercise the utmost care in your dealings with these individuals, for they are known to be persons most dangerous to cross, and maintain a veil of secrecy about their affairs that borders upon the impenetrable. We possess no further intelligence regarding their present location nor the means by which they might be contacted.
Proceed, therefore, with wisdom and circumspection in all your undertakings.
