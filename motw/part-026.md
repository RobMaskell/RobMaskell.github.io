# The Pursuit from Sterlinghart's Estate

December 19th 1896 - Evening

*Being a faithful account of the harrowing events of December 19th, 1896, wherein our intrepid hunters faced pursuit, danger, and difficult choices in their ongoing battle against the forces of darkness.*
## The Flight from Danger
As the winter evening of December 19th deepened into true darkness, our band of extraordinary gentlemen found themselves fleeing Lord Sterlinghart's estate with their precious prize—the Egyptian Tablet of the Dead—secured within their carriage. Samuel Fitzwilliam, in his spectral form, had successfully returned to his quill case for safer transport, whilst the stalwart Gabriel West took command of the reins from the absent Sean, his experience with horses proving invaluable in their desperate flight.
The carriage bore not only our heroes but also Lord Sterlinghart himself, rescued from the demonic clutches that had held his family captive. Yet their escape was far from assured, for as they departed the estate grounds, Kyle Nugget's vigilant watch revealed three horsemen in pursuit—among them the dreaded Harrington Frostbane and his demonic confederates.
## A Running Battle Upon the London Road
What followed was a most cinematographic chase along the London road, with our heroes displaying remarkable ingenuity under the most pressing circumstances. Samuel, ever the scholar even in his ethereal state, employed his poltergeist abilities to create chaos amongst their pursuers, causing luggage to burst forth from the carriage's rear in a spectacular display of flying garments and gentleman's accoutrements. This supernatural barrage left their enemies momentarily confounded, horses rearing with underthings draped across their faces.
George Banks, displaying the martial prowess befitting his angelic nature, crafted an ingenious Molotov cocktail from the carriage's well-appointed bar, complete with purple silk from the interior furnishings as a wick. His aim proved true, though the flames were short-lived against the wind of their galloping pursuit.
In a display of both daring and questionable judgment, George then attempted to employ the low-hanging branches as a natural trap, fashioning a lasso from rope and torn curtains. His timing, whilst admirable in intent, proved imperfect—successfully unseating one pursuer but resulting in his own precarious position, dangling from the carriage's rear like some Victorian action hero of the penny dreadfuls.
## Heroics and Mishaps
The evening's excitement reached fever pitch when Gabriel West's attempt at magical assistance—seeking to create flammable terrain through mystical means—was thwarted by his distraction with the precious wine he carried. A low-hanging branch claimed poor Sean, leaving him suspended in the trees (though one suspects he was rather pleased to finally have an opportunity for adventure).
Kyle Nugget's marksmanship proved decisive when he dispatched Frostbane's horse with a single, expertly placed shot between the eyes. George, meanwhile, had employed his flaming sword to devastating effect upon another mount, though at considerable personal cost—taking grievous harm from Frostbane's trampling charge.
Yet even this seemed insufficient to stop their supernatural adversary, for Frostbane's demonic nature allowed him to teleport directly onto their escaping carriage, leading to a desperate struggle between the arch-demon and Samuel's wrathful spirit.
## Resolution and Refuge
The confrontation's climax saw both Samuel and Kyle coordinate their supernatural and mundane abilities—Samuel engaging Frostbane in spectral combat whilst Kyle struck with the ravenshade dagger. Their combined efforts succeeded in dislodging the demon from their conveyance, leaving him battered and defeated on the roadway.
The remainder of their journey proceeded without incident, allowing Gabriel to tend to Kyle's wounds with his medical expertise, whilst the group made their way to a safe house in Highgate. There, they deposited the Sterlinghart family under the capable protection of one Gertrude, a formidable matron whose knuckle-cracking suggested she was more than adequate to the task of guardian.
## Difficult Decisions
With Lord Sterlinghart safely reunited with his family and provided with appropriate compensation documentation (Gabriel's thoroughness in financial matters proving as meticulous as his other skills), our heroes faced a crucial decision. Gabriel West revealed knowledge of an alternative organization—referred to cryptically as "The Foundation"—suggesting they might find safer harbour and better resources there than at the compromised Embers Society.
The debate that followed revealed much about each gentleman's character: Samuel's scholarly pragmatism, George's noble concern for their abandoned colleagues, Kyle's heroic determination, and Gabriel's strategic thinking. The question of where to secure the Tablet of the Dead—that most dangerous artifact whose loss could spell doom for all humanity—weighed heavily upon their deliberations.
As our account closes, our heroes remain encamped upon Hampstead Heath, the London lights visible in the distance, weighing their options as the forces of darkness surely marshal their strength for the trials ahead. The tablet remains in their possession, but for how long? And what price will they pay to keep it from those who would use it to bring about the end of all things?
The adventure continues, with our brave hunters facing their gravest challenges yet in the gaslit streets and hidden corners of Her Majesty's great capital...

*Next session: The hunters must decide their course—will they seek aid from Gabriel's mysterious "Foundation," attempt to secure the tablet in some impregnable location, or make their stand at the familiar halls of the Embers Society? The fate of the world may well hang in the balance.*
