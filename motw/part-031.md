# A Most Harrowing Evening of Mayhem and Demonic Machinations

December 21th 1896 - Absurdly Early Morning

*Being a True and Faithful Account of the Hunters' Travails*

## Chapter I: The Escape from Public Accommodation
Our tale commences in the upper chambers of a public house, where our intrepid band found themselves in most precarious circumstances. Master Kyle Nugget, that rotund yet surprisingly agile gentleman, had concluded his gaming activities with rather explosive results - having conducted intimate relations with one Pablo's sister, a circumstance that rendered their continued presence most unwelcome among the establishment's other patrons.

George Banks, the Divine messenger, emerged from his interrogations with intelligence regarding young Gabriel's whereabouts, though his methods - described euphemistically as "localized flooding" - were doubtless more biblical in their execution than his modest description suggested. The predicament was thus: Sean lay unconscious upon a bed, Samuel Fitzwilliam resided within Kyle's person in spectral form, and four determined gentlemen were ascending the stairs with murderous intent.

Kyle, displaying the sort of courage that only desperation can inspire, charged headlong at the lead assailant, creating what can only be described as a cascade of humanity tumbling down the staircase like dominoes. Meanwhile, Sean awakened to Samuel's urgent entreaties, and after brief confusion regarding the ancient scholar's incorporeal state, gathered his wits and the precious artifacts in his care.

The masterstroke came when Sean, brandishing what appeared to be a peculiar cross-topped device, proclaimed it to be a "grenade" - a term requiring explanation to the Victorian ruffians but delivered with such conviction that they scattered like leaves before an autumn gale. "This is a grenade," declared our mundane hero repeatedly as he descended, each repetition adding weight to his theatrical performance.

## Chapter II: The Frontal Assault Upon The Foundation's Safe House
Having successfully extricated themselves from the public house, our hunters made swift progress to the address obtained through George's divine interrogation. The sound of breaking glass - Gabriel's desperate signal from within - spurred them to greater haste, arriving at what proved to be a Foundation safe house of most sinister aspect.

Sean's approach was refreshingly direct: a simple knock upon the door, followed by his declaration that he was "the postman" - a profession that, even at such an ungodly hour, apparently required no further explanation. When the door opened to reveal an unsuspecting guardian, George delivered what can only be described as a headbutt of Old Testament proportions, causing the unfortunate fellow to expire from what the learned might term an aneurysm, though George's divine smiting was undoubtedly the proximate cause.

## Chapter III: Gabriel's Predicament and Magical Misadventure
Within the confines of his prison chamber, Gabriel West found himself bound alongside the enigmatic Novilium Black. Recognizing that subtlety had long since departed the evening's proceedings, Gabriel attempted to enhance his makeshift weapons through magical means. The enchantment of glass shards embedded in his hands should have been a simple matter, yet the cosmos had other plans.

The magic succeeded, after a fashion, but with consequences most severe. Black flames danced about the glass fragments, transforming his bindings into weapons of terrible aspect. However, the synthetic bedding materials melted and fused to his hands, creating what Samuel would later observe resembled "boxing gloves with glass poking out of them" - effective as weapons, but rendering fine manipulation impossible.

When their guard arrived to investigate the disturbance, the confrontation was swift and decisive. Gabriel's new armaments proved most effective in slitting the man's wrists, while Black's improvised chair-leg club found its mark through the villain's ear. The guard expired without raising an alarm, though the sound of his collapse doubtless alerted others to their escape.

## Chapter IV: The Werewolf Encounter
The reunion of our heroes in the parlour below was marked by an unwelcome discovery: three men had undergone the lycanthropic transformation, presenting themselves as fully-formed werewolves of most aggressive disposition. The beasts had clearly been stationed as guardians, and the evening's cacophony had triggered their bestial change.

Gabriel, despite his handicapped state, managed to engage one of the creatures, his magical glass-studded fists proving effective against the supernatural threat. George, appearing with divine timing through his orbing ability, found himself armed with naught but his fists - though for an angelic warrior, this proved sufficient. His smiting abilities transformed even his bare hands into weapons of terrible power.

The battle was fierce but brief. Gabriel's magical strikes and George's divine pugilism laid two of the beasts low, while the third grappled with Black upon the floor. Gabriel's rugby tackle freed Black from immediate danger, allowing George to deliver the coup de grâce with Arceus, his flaming sword, opening the creature from sternum to spine in a most spectacular display of divine retribution.

## Chapter V: The Gunfight and Kyle's Heroism
As our heroes regrouped, the four survivors from the public house arrived with violent intent, leading to a tense stand-off at the parlour door. Kyle, despite his corpulent frame and recent injury, displayed remarkable tactical acumen by firing two shots from his anachronistic magnum through the wooden portal. The weapon, described as a "hand cannon" of considerable stopping power, dropped two assailants immediately.

Samuel, in his spectral form, contributed by animating the coats in the entrance hall, creating sufficient supernatural distraction to unnerve the remaining attackers. When Sean threatened to remain and search the fallen, Kyle demonstrated admirable leadership by physically extracting his companion from the line of fire, taking a bullet to the leg in the process but preserving Sean from harm.
The confrontation concluded with George's surgical removal of an attacker's arm using his divine blade, the flaming sword cauterizing the wound even as it severed the limb. The psychological effect upon the remaining assailant proved decisive, causing him to abandon his wounded comrade and flee into the London night.

## Chapter VI: The Ascent and Discovery of C-12
Gabriel's urgency to recover his equipment led him and Black upstairs, where they discovered not only his prototype flamethrower and weapons, but also evidence of a far graver threat. The sound of footsteps from the floor above suggested additional occupants, prompting a careful investigation.
What they discovered in the upper chamber was a tableau that spoke of treachery most foul: a woman seated upon a bed and a man bound to a chair. Samuel's supernatural senses immediately identified the woman as demonic in nature, while Gabriel recognized her as C-12, a Foundation operative of considerable authority.

The revelation that C-12 had been possessed - or worse, had willingly collaborated - with demonic forces struck at the very heart of the Foundation's integrity. Her claim to have "taken over the Foundation" suggested a conspiracy of terrifying scope, while the bound man, identified as Barnabas by Black, represented those who had refused to join what she termed "the winning side."

## Chapter VII: The Demonic Confrontation and Samuel's Heroism
The confrontation with the possessed C-12 required all of our heroes' combined skills and considerable theatrical ability. When she demanded that Gabriel prove his loyalty by executing Black, our Foundation operative delivered a performance worthy of the stage, apparently turning traitor while secretly coordinating with his companions.

Gabriel's feigned assault upon Black, complete with pulled punches and whispered reassurances, provided the distraction necessary for Samuel to breach the supernatural barrier that had constrained him. The ancient scholar's assault upon the demon was a thing of terrible beauty - a battle of wills made manifest as streams of black and ethereal energy clashed in the confined space.

Samuel's exorcism succeeded, though not without cost. The demon, torn from its host with considerable force, immediately counterattacked, leading to a spectacular battle of supernatural energies that consumed much of what Samuel might term "the effects budget." Though both combatants suffered in the exchange, Samuel's immortal nature and tactical acumen allowed him to endure what would have destroyed a mortal man.

## Chapter VIII: The Escape and Revelation
George's intervention, ungagging the bound Barnabas, provided the crucial warning that C-12 was "not just a demon" - though the full implications of this ominous statement remained unclear as events accelerated beyond all control. The exorcism's success proved temporary, as the demon immediately re-possessed its host, demonstrating a level of supernatural persistence that spoke to its considerable power. C-12 disappeared in what appeared to be the demon version of George's orb ability.

George's divine orbing removed him from immediate danger, but the sound of a gunshot from below indicated that the threat had merely relocated rather than been eliminated. The hunters' tactical withdrawal to their waiting carriages seemed prudent, until Kyle's eyes fell upon the figure emerging from the house.

The woman who stepped forth, weapon in hand, was none other than Patricia - Kyle's former wife, now apparently serving as vessel for a demonic entity. The recognition was mutual and immediate, two pairs of eyes meeting across the London street with all the weight of broken matrimony and supernatural horror combined.

As our heroes faced this most personal and terrifying of revelations - that Kyle's romantic indiscretions might somehow be connected to the very forces threatening to end the world - the evening's events reached their most dramatic crescendo.

# Questions for the Next Session:
* Will Kyle's ex-wife Patricia remember to ask for alimony before attempting to murder him?
* Has George finally met someone who can out-headbutt him, or will divine smiting trump demonic possession?
* Can Samuel successfully explain to Black why everyone else seems to be having telepathic conversations while he stands there looking confused?
* Will Gabriel ever be able to use his hands for anything more delicate than punching werewolves?
* Is Sean going to try to negotiate with a demon using his grenade, and will anyone remember to tell him it's not actually a grenade?
* How many more of Kyle's ex-wives are going to turn up as supernatural threats before this is over?
* Will the carriage horses bolt at the sight of demons, leaving our heroes stranded in Victorian London?
* Can George resist the urge to orb directly into Patricia's face with a flaming sword?
* Is there anyone left in London who isn't either dead, possessed, or romantically connected to Kyle?
* Will the real tablet please stand up, and does anyone actually remember which one is which at this point?
