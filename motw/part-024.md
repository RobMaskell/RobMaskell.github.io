# The battle of the church

December 19th 1896 - Early-Evening

Kyles awakes, on the floor of a moving carriage, hands and feet lightly tied. It appears that there is no one else in the carriage. He doesn't find his gun, seems to have been taken, but they didn't search him for other weapons in the rush as he can feel his knives. Kyle manages to manipulate one of his knives using his man-boob to a position where he can cut his restraints. In doing so he makes enough noise for the drivers to notice, they bring the carriage to a dead stop. Kyles braces himself against the door for the when they open it. Kyle jumps out at them knocking the one opening the door flying rolling onto the second man who manages to get Kyle into a choke hold. Kyle just about manages to stab the guy in the eye causing him to release the choke. Kyle jumps up and onto the carriage and heads back towards the house. He's not great at driving the carriage and the reins fall out of his hand, causing the carriage to hit the side of the road rut and crash onto it's side throwing Kyle into a nearby hedge. He's still a mile of so from the gate to Sterlinghart's mansion.

Sean sees the carriage crashing with a large man driving erratically and suspects it's Kyle, he lets the others know via Samuel and suggests George go to get him. George decides against this at least initially.

King Eketep is stood at one end of the church, there are many boxes, statues and there is sand everywhere. The rest of the crew all kneel before him, he requests that they all pledge allegiance. Sean stands up and attempts some diplomacy. Gabriel takes his opportunity to run to the back of the church, he is followed there by a spinning tablet which was the first this Eketep could lay his hands on, Gabriel dodges it and it smashes into a nearby statue and brakes apart, knocking the statue over the now prone Gabriel. George is still kneeling, in front of Eketep, and when asked about the box he grabs George, walks him over to it and translates the hieroglyphs at the bottom, in the same way that Sterlinghart had previously. Head, Heart, Jar, Destruction. 

It's Sterlinghart's turn and he tries to argue with the mummified remains of Eketep. The king start moving in his direction. Samuel is quietly looking around for jars or vases that might have the same hieroglyphs on them. Sean attempts to distract the mummy with a speech about needing a cushion to kneel properly and pledge his allegiance. Eketep is annoyed now and appears to be making the sand lying around everywhere swirl up like a sandstorm causing everyone's visibility to drop.

Kyle, drags his arse out of the hedge, he searches the carriage to see if he can work out who those men were. He finds a letter from an old acquaintance, Artemos, a pimp of ill repute that Kyle had some previous dealings with. After this he frees one of the horses and after attempting to mount it ends up lying his bulk across it, this works for a while as he nears the gate of Lord Sterlinghart's mansion, but in the end he falls off into another hedge. He sneaks into the grounds and heads around the side of the house, using bushes for cover. He comes face to face with a guard dog, and unsure of what it actually is pulls one of his knives. He tentatively holds out one of his hands while trying to get his jacket off.

In the church George is taking exception to being asked to bend the knee, shouts at the mummy. Sean gets to some high ground and has had enough so breaks out his rifle. He shoots, he hits, but it appears to be little more than an annoyance to Eketep, who picks up another tablet and launches it in Sean's general direction. Instead of smashing, it hits the wall nearby with a loud thunk and takes a lump out of the wall. Gabriel notices, he might not be the only one. As Eketep advances on him, Sean shoots the rope holding a wooden wheel candelabra up and it falls onto Eketep who gets caught up in it temporarily. Sean decides to charge the mummy with his pocket knife held in front of him, Gabriel assists him by shooting Eketep with his shotgun.

Back in the grounds Kyle and the dog circle each other until one lunges and they both take a chunk out of each other, the dog coming off worst with a knife through it's chest killing it, but not before Kyle is badly injured. Kyle, now close enough reaches out telepathically to Samuel with a cry for help.

In the church, George runs at Eketep with his flaming sword of justice and slashes him across the body, and immediately uses his angle wings to bamf to Kyle. Kyle is a sight for George though, his clothes torn, body bloodied and for the first time no hat! George sees an orange glow from Kyle's head as he jams his hat back on. Did you kill the dog? Why are you covered in bacon? asks George. George lays his hands onto Kyle to heal and stabilise him.

Samuel find a large jar with the hieroglyph of a heart on the side. Gabriel and Sean break open the jar to reveal a shrivelled heart. Sean taunts Eketep, telling him this is how democracy works. Gabriel attempts to keep Eketep occupied by tipping a nearby statue onto him.

Kyle wants to bamf back to the action with George's angel wings, but George is not convinced, taking extra people for a ride along has not gone well in the past. Eventually they do it anyway and successfully this time. Kyle, once he has his bearings, stabs at the shrivelled heart, but to no obvious effect. Samuel find another vase and uses his abilities to throw it against a wall and smash it. Inside is a shrivelled brain.

Eketep, having extricated himself from the statue puts his hand out and moves towards the closet person he can see, Sean. Sean tries again to talk the mummy round, even finding a cushion and offering to bend the knee. Kyle remembers things about mummies and suggests it would be bad to get touched by one. Sean picks up another tablet and tries to defend himself with it to avoid being touched. Sean falls forward. Kyle stabs the brain, again to no obvious effect. Gabriel has had enough and uses his prototype flamethrower to burn the heart and the brain. He's nearly out of juice now. On the final destruction of the heart and brain, the mummy turns to dust and collapses into a pile of bandages.

Gabriel goes to grab the tablet that didn't smash when it was thrown. Samuel again reaches out to the ghost he'd met before but gets nothing. In the end they ask Sterlinghart to read it and he confirms it appears to be the tablet of the dead.

A quick plan is made to make tracks, Gabriel points out that their carriage is gone, taking the other Sterlingharts to safety and may or may not be back yet. A discussion ensues, can they get to one of Sterlinghart's carriages, should they just make a run for it? Should Sean try to distract everyone by standing outside the church and letting everyone know they have the tablet? It's also suggested to Sterlinghart that he forget most of what he has seen. Sterlinghart is asked if he values the church, the influence of Sean on the group grows and they consider burning it down. George is the hold out, he is against burning a house of God.

In the end Gabriel's backpack is used to construct a small explosive device which George will set off with his sword and then wings to them in the tunnel back to the house. Sean goes outside to shout about the tablet, hoping to draw attention and once this is done runs back inside. Gabriel has the tablet, Sean has the quill case, Kyle looks like he might not make it. The plan is to go through the house cellar to the other side and then head for the village.

With the plans in place... Sean yells at the top of his lungs!
