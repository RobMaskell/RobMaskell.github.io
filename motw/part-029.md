# A Most Perilous Evening's Work: A Chronicle of the Hunters' Latest Tribulations

December 20th 1896 - Late Afternoon

*Being a faithful account of the events of the twentieth of December, as recorded by a diligent observer of these remarkable gentlemen's ongoing campaign against the forces of darkness*

## Chapter I: A Gathering Storm
As our tale resumes on this cold December evening, our intrepid band of hunters found themselves divided across London's sprawling metropolis. The angelic George Banks, accompanied by the ethereal Samuel Fitzwilliam, had retreated to George's sumptuous Kensington residence to parley with one Syrus - an ancient vampire of considerable standing and, as fate would have it, an old acquaintance of our celestial protagonist. Meanwhile, the stalwart Kyle Nugget and the incendiary Sean remained at the Amber Society headquarters, tending to the aftermath of their recent skirmishes with the dark forces that press ever closer to their apocalyptic goal.

The gravity of their situation had become most apparent: their adversaries possessed two of the three components necessary for their world-ending ritual, both the diamond and, most disturbingly, an alpha vampire whose entire Welsh sect had been destroyed in service of this dark purpose. Only the tablet remained beyond the enemy's grasp, though this advantage was soon to prove more precarious than anticipated.

George's divine assistant, the snowy owl Hubert - a creature of heavenly origin possessed of both considerable intellect and an equally considerable attitude - served as messenger between the separated companions. "I can find George," declared the bird with characteristic bluntness, "the powers that be above have always given me the ability." Indeed, Hubert's celestial connection to his angelic charge proved most useful in these trying times, though his acerbic personality often tested the patience of all concerned.

## Chapter II: Revelations Most Dire
Within George's well-appointed flat, the situation took a decidedly perilous turn. Samuel, in his spectral wanderings about the premises, made several disturbing observations. Through his incorporeal reconnaissance, the ghostly scholar noted with growing alarm that whilst the residence was admirably protected against demonic intrusion - courtesy of George's angelic blood and various mystical safeguards - it remained woefully vulnerable to werewolf assault. "No bear traps in the hall, that kind of thing," as the situation was succinctly described.

More immediately concerning was Samuel's discovery of a suspicious figure maintaining prolonged surveillance from across the street. "Leaning against the lamppost on the other side of the street is a man," the Elizabethan spirit reported with his characteristic directness. "He just seems to be smoking and reading the paper." This watcher had maintained his position for an unconscionable length of time, suggesting purposes far from innocent.

The vampire Syrus, despite his centuries of experience, proved unable to identify the mysterious observer, declaring with simple honesty: "It's nothing to do with me." Samuel's further investigations revealed the presence of the steampunk carriage of their previous ghost hunting antagonists, positioned strategically near a public house down the road - the very establishment where Samuel had previously conducted his violent haunting activities.

## Chapter III: Divine Intervention and Earthly Concerns
George's situation took an unexpected turn when his attempt to return swiftly to his companions via his angelic transportation abilities went spectacularly awry. Having acquired from the Order of the Veiled Dawn's reliquary the legendary "Holy Hand Grenade of Trump" - an artifact of such devastating potential that it had reportedly been used to "completely wipe out one of those continents" in ages past - George found himself summoned before the heavenly court.

The Archangel Michael himself materialized to deliver urgent intelligence: Gabriel West, their Foundation-affiliated companion, had not reached his intended destination and was, according to divine foresight, crucial to preventing the world's destruction. "We think he is important in what is to come," Michael declared with celestial authority, "and you should immediately try to locate him."

The conversation also revealed the true magnitude of the Holy Hand Grenade's power. "Thrown by an angel, it might do more damage than you require," Michael cautioned, advising that the weapon be entrusted to "the most mundane person possible." This cosmic consultation concluded with George's transportation back to the mortal realm, though not without considerable difficulty - his arrival in the middle of Kensington High Street requiring swift evasive action to avoid being trampled by passing carriages.

## Chapter IV: Subterfuge and Mechanical Acquisition
The reunion of Sean and Kyle with their celestial companion proved fortuitous, as their journey across London had been marked by the unwelcome attention of a mysterious pursuer. Their subsequent employment of what Sean termed "a Jason Bourne" manoeuvre - involving elaborate deceptions with underground railway carriages - provided both excitement and, ultimately, success in evading their tail, though Kyle's physical limitations nearly compromised the endeavour.

Upon reaching George's residence and learning of their dire circumstances, the group made a decision that would have seemed unconscionable under normal circumstances: the theft of the steampunk carriage belonging to their ghostly adversaries. Sean's plan was elegantly simple in its audacity: "We get close to the driver... just clobber him. No. Get rid of the driver straight away, and we're away."

The execution proved rather more complex, requiring Sean's considerable skills in social manipulation to distract the driver with discussions of wheel craftsmanship while Kyle employed the butt of his magnum pistol to render the unfortunate fellow unconscious. The appropriation of the vehicle, complete with its ingenious spirit dispensary system, provided them with both transportation and refreshment for the trials ahead.

## Chapter V: The Sacred Quest
Their destination, revealed through Hubert's aerial reconnaissance, was a church near Westminster's great clock - the site where Gabriel had previously been observed by Hubert. The assembled company now consisted of a most unusual fellowship: the angelic George bearing the precious tablet in a leather satchel, Kyle carrying Samuel's quill case, Sean carrying the devastating Holy Hand Grenade and armed with his customary enthusiasm for pyrotechnics. The ancient vampire Syrus had been dispatched to rally what remained of London's vampire population for the coming assault on the mansion where the rite was to be performed.

The church itself proved deceptively peaceful - a traditional house of worship tended by a rector whose enthusiasm for theological discussion knew no bounds. Sean's masterful performance as a devout traveller seeking spiritual solace provided excellent cover for Kyle's acquisition of a suitable stone tablet from the pulpit, while George engaged the clergyman in discussions of biblical passages concerning the angel Gabriel.

Most significantly, their search yielded a crucial clue: a business card bearing the name "Joshua Barker" and adorned with the image of a building's foundation - the symbol of that shadowy organization known as The Foundation. This discovery suggested that Gabriel's disappearance might indeed be connected to his professional affiliations rather than mere misadventure.

Hubert was then dispatched to the remains of the Order with instruction left to let our plucky heroes know if more assistance was required and to request assistance from their celestial masters.

## Chapter VI: The Mystical Arts
Samuel's spectral expertise will prove invaluable in their plans to create a convincing forgery of the ancient tablet. Through the application of his otherworldly abilities and Kyle's "preparedness" in knowing one Mason Stone - a stonemason conveniently working in the area - they are preparing to craft a duplicate that might deceive their enemies. The ethereal scholar's magic would guide the chisel work, though he warned of the inherent risks: "Magic is weird, always comes with potential side effects."

The session concluded with the successful acquisition of both the blank tablet and the crucial intelligence regarding Joshua Barker's potential connection to Gabriel's fate. The company now possessed the means to create their deception, though the true test of their cunning lay ahead.

# Questions Most Pressing Regarding Future Proceedings:
* Can SEan be trusted with a weapon capable of continental destruction, or might he just set it afire?
* Can Samuel's ghostly guidance successfully direct Mason Stone's chisel without transforming the poor fellow into amphibian form, and will anyone think to warn him of this possibility?
* Has Syrus successfully rallied London's vampire population, or has he simply wandered off in search of a proper meal and better company?
* Will Sean's enthusiasm for ecclesiastical architecture prove sufficient disguise for their increasingly suspicious activities around London's churches?
* Does Joshua Barker truly hold the key to Gabriel's whereabouts, or is this merely another red herring in their increasingly complex investigation?
* Can George maintain his angelic dignity while riding about London in a stolen steampunk carriage, and will the original owners prove forgiving of this vehicular appropriation?
* Will the mysterious watcher outside George's flat prove to be merely an eccentric gentleman with poor timing, or something far more sinister?
* Has Hubert finally secured his promised Australian mouse, or will George's credibility with his divine assistant continue its steady decline?
* Will the rector's theological enthusiasm prove sufficient distraction from their various thefts, or might Sunday service feature some rather pointed sermons about missing church property?
