# Letters, Confessions and Lies

December 15th 1896 - Evening

Our hunters head back to the club, after a hard night. George heads out to Vanessa's office at The Times. He just about gets away with the ensuing  break-in, and removes the letter mentioned from a locked desk draw.

Gabriel gets started on the paperwork covering the previous adventures, his report while mostly fair and accurate does seem to load a fair quantity of the blame onto George, not a surprise given the note and him throwing George under the omnibus earlier that evening. They head to sleep it off, the night passes uneventfully. Those that eat have sausage pancakes for breakfast. Gabriel heads to the stores and avails himself of a new whipblade.

December 16th 1896 - Morning

They are summoned to Clerkonwell's office... There is a discussion about the letter Gabriel left in Vanessa's office on behalf of George. Clerkonwell tells them off and asks if they are capable of working together, and suggests that for the good of the world they need to. They discuss what they are going to try next, the diamond, the Tablet of the Dead, Kyle's ex Isadora Featherstone (who he can't currently remember). Kyle deals with this by heading off to the post room, collecting more sausages on the way.

My dear Kyle,

Your letter has found me well, and I must thank you for your kind words regarding my recent travels. While Egypt has its dangers, I can assure you that I have returned largely unscathed—both body and soul remain free from curses, despite the ill-tempered scorpions and rather petulant deities encountered along the way.

I am most pleased to accept your gracious invitation to The Amber Society’s next gathering at 7pm this evening. It would be my distinct pleasure to regale the members with tales from the Nile, and, as you so delightfully suggest, to share with you some pieces from my collection—yes, even the jackal-headed statuette, if it can be persuaded to relinquish its current resting place.

The Society’s thirst for knowledge and taste for the unusual has always held a certain charm for me, and I am certain I shall enjoy the company of such a refined (if eccentric) gathering. I trust that a few choice words and artefacts shall satisfy their curiosity, though I shall endeavour to include just enough peril to make the tales worth their salt. After all, what is archaeology without the looming shadow of an ancient curse?

Consider this my formal acceptance. I look forward to what promises to be a most engaging and lively evening among friends and fellow antiquarians. Rest assured, I shall bring treasures that will delight both eye and mind—though I can make no guarantees about any...unexpected supernatural disturbances.

Until then, my dear friend, may the spirits rest easy and your Society’s thirst for adventure never wane.

Yours sincerely,
Lord Reginald Sterlinghard

Gabriel receives a visitor. Turns out to be a representative of Mr Black the head of The Foundation he works for. Black wants to meet him at a certain church this evening at 8pm. The visitor also takes away Gabriel's latest notes.

George takes a moment to compare the handwriting on the note he salvaged from Vanessa's office to Gabriel's latest report to Clerkonwell to identify that Gabriel wrote it. They discuss the letter, George accuses Gabriel of writing it, and Gabriel wonders how since angels can't lie how he did about the letter to Clerkonwell. George asks Gabriel if he is ok? and offers an olive branch asking if Gabriel needs any help. Gabriel tries to get help from his agency to clear his name with George.

Kyle spends time drinking and Sean services his knives and guns. Samuel and Kyle spend some time reading up on arch demons to see if any of them strike a chord with Octavian. He also investigates the Octavian family tree. They find out a lot of information on Demon hierarchy, their powers and weaknesses.

Reginald Sterlinghard arrives ahead of his talk, and Kyle saunters up to him and they get talking. They bond over their shared love of Egypt.

Gabriel leaves for his appointment, and after a sarcastic chat between Hubert and George, his owl companion follows Gabriel to report back later.

Samuel sees a ghost Mummy, he would be the only one to see it of course. Sean and George suggest that Samuel makes contact to see what he can find out? Samuel asks about the tablet, and the ghost tells him it was in his tomb.

Gabriel arrives at the church after a bracing walk in the chill evening air. Followed by Hubert swooping overhead. Hubert is seen as Gabriel takes in the scene sizing up the threats that may be in the church. Eventually he goes in, makes a crucifix with his hand having dipped a finger in the font. He enters the confession booth, but keeps his foot in the door just in case. Black is in the other half of the confession booth, they introduce themselves and after Gabriel gives Black an update, Black tells Gabriel he has concerns about The Foundation and specifically C12 who he believes to have gone rogue. He wants Gabriel to help implicate him and catch him in the act. Given what Gabriel has done in response to the Octavian situation he believes he can trust Gabriel. He's also told that he can use his team and asked if any of them are good enough to recruit? If they can be trusted. With this new information Gabriel heads back to his flat.

Back at the talk, Sean chats with Reginald afterwards, asks to see his collection, and describes his interest in stories and that the Egyptians used to scribe onto stones. He'd like to see any of these that Reginald has, Reginald agrees.

## Questions
* How are Gabriel and George going to resolve their smouldering feud?
* Will it compromise the mission?
* What's next... Diamond / Tablet of the Dead / Alpha Vampire
* How can Gabriel implicate C12? Does he even want to?
* Will they find the tablet in Lord Sterlinghard's collection?
* If they do where will they hide it from Octavian?
