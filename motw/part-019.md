# On saving old friends and hands

December 17th 1896 - Night

Discussions on exiting the stationary cupboard range from "Well we are not dead", through "I have the dagger", to a suggestion that Sean gets a psych eval for the murders committed. George makes a suggestion they they should stop murdering people, he makes the point that "upstairs" don't look too kindly on that kind of thing.

Gabriel and George head to the infirmary to get some treatment, they are looking pretty beat up. Samuel, being a ghost, will just have to hope he will heal over time.

December 18th 1896 - Mid morning

As the chaps reappear in the morning and pick up a bit of breakfast, Clerkonwell summons them all into his office for a de-brief. He asks them how it went last night and they tell him the story of the night's escapade. Gabriel notes the murder of the human guards in his report, but doesn't mention the forged note. Sean tells them that he kissed his Sargent's wife Betty when he was serving in Africa. George reports that he smote a Pomeranian 700 years ago thinking it was the devil. We all make mistakes. Clerkonwell admonishes them for the killing of the innocent and reminds them of that one of the reasons the Veiled Dawn exists is to protect the innocent.

Clerkonwell tells them them that order lookouts at the old Slaughter house in Millwall have reported a pitch battle taking place there, many dead, bodies everywhere. He'll be sending a clean up crew down to remove the evidence later.

Then he gets down to business, asking them what their plan is now and how he can use the resources of the Veiled Dawn to assist them. Gabriel starts, and thinks going to see Lord Sterlinghart and getting the Tablet of the Dead is easiest, there are possibly other ways to get a large diamond and many alpha vampires, but most likely only one tablet. He thinks that they can use the tablet as leverage, by not destroying it, but using it to hook Frostholm and try to kill him with the dagger. There is a suggestion to use the ghosts at Sterlinghart's mansion to identify the tablet, as there are likely many such artifacts have been transported back from Egypt. They suggest they could ask Vanessa to put a story out about the tablet in order to tweak Frostholm's interest. Clerkonwell likes the plan as such but ponders out loud if killing Frostholm will stop it, or if someone else will just step up into his place and carry on with the summoning.

George, who along with Gabriel is looking a little better this morning after his overnight stay in the infirmary, says he wants to check out the slaughter house and will join the others en route to the tablet.

The others want to go to the bookshop and see if they can get any information about Frostholm from the proprietor. Gabriel says he has some things to do and will join them at the shop after. George quips that maybe another grand daughter is sick.

George relays the story of him and Syrus the vampire. How a witch had given him his soul back and that a healing by George when he was gravely ill had resulted in his soul being ripped out again. Never mind the trouble healing a vampire had caused for George upstairs... all forgiven now after his sacrifice at the old monastery.

George bamfs to the the docks, reappearing in a blue orb that coalesces to a human form. He appears where the crew faced the octopus threat last time as it's a place he'd been before. He walks around to the slaughter house and the information from the boss was right, bodies everywhere, he checks them for wounds and finds claw marks and puncture wounds consistent with a fight between vampires and werewolves. There don't seem to be any survivors, or none that stayed around anyway. He heads into the slaughter house proper and looks around for survivors, in the middle behind a machine he hears a moaning and finds a mortally wounded Syrus. He recognises him immediately and tries to heal him. They start a conversation, Syrus tells him that he united the vampire clans enough for this assault and that he thinks they killed off most of the werewolves. George hides Syrus under a metal floor grate, then heads off to the offices to see if he can find anything. While in the office he tries to do his usual trick of opening a locked desk drawer with his flaming sword. This time the draw has been booby trapped and George os caught in the explosion and blown back against the wall. He bamfs back to the infirmary to get help and is healed by an order magic healer.

Sean, Kyle and Samuel arrive at the bookshop, “Foibles Fantastic Emporium for Nik Naks and the Occult”, it looks the same as before. Kyle knowing about the owner, has donned his Fez, has his now two daggers secreted about his person, the blessed dagger and the Ravenshade dagger. They enter and see the proprietor Silas Dunmore looking back at them from behind the desk. As they all head through the door, Sean swivels the open/closed sign to closed and start looking around at the books. Kyle starts talking to Silas, trying to find information, but ends up trying to stab at his hand with the Ravenshade dagger. He misses, the dagger embedded itself deep into the desk and Kyle gets a punch in the face for his trouble temporarily disorienting him long enough for Silas to grab the Ravenshade dagger. Sean gets behind Silas and holds a small dagger to his throat, asking, nee, telling him to let go of the dagger he's holding. Sean, coming round from the punch, asks Samuel to sweep the room to look for anyone else. In Kyles attempt to rest the dagger from Silas, Sean ends up cutting his throat such that he can no longer speak. When he tries it comes out as gurgling and hissing.

Gabriel walks down the street, snack of roasted nuts in his hand, he's heading to his drop sites. At C12's dead drop, which is a pigeon pen, where one of the pigeons is fake and the the drop is underneath. He leaves a note, a burned skeleton fragment. He informs C12 that he's located the tablet and then gives him a false address. He asks for orders. The other dead drop is for Novilium Black, it's a park railing, where the spike at the top unscrews and a note can be rolled up and secreted inside. Here he leaves a note detailing that he has found one of the components required for the summoning and told C12 a false location for the tablet and asked C12 for orders.

After dropping off at the two dead drops, Gabriel heads to the shop to meet up with the others. Looking through the window he sees the situation, Silas holding the dagger, throat slit etc and decides against entering. He waits outside to dissuade any passer by from entering the shop. He is successful with the first likely customer, he waits near the front door looking nasty.

Back inside the shop, Samuel looks on at the violence and wishes these things could be accomplished with less knives and less stabbing and cutting. They start to question Silas again, this time offering him a notepad that he can write on with his off-hand. They ask about the order, what order he says, Frostholm's they reply. Silas writes that he can't say, he'll be killed. Someone says "Start writing or you're going to die anyway". He asks if they can save him, he's told they can save his soul. He asks if his hand can be saved, as he notices the black veins that are radiating out from his hand and starting up his arm. He's told that one of his hands can be saved...

## Questions
* Will Vanessa help them write a story about the tablet?
* What will happen to Syrus, will he be discovered?
* Will Gabriel's ruse be enough to implicate C12?
* What orders will C12 give to Gabriel and what will he tell Black?
* What will they do about the dagger?
* Can they save Silas? All of Silas?
