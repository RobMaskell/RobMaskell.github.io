# Fickle memories and pointy things

December 16th 1896 - Evening

The crew decide to follow the two new members as they leave the Ambers Society building. Kyle heads back to pick up Samuel's Quill Case. Samuel heads through the building, literally, to the front to see the two men trying to hail a hackney carriage. Sean finishes up his conversation with Lord Sterlinghart about Egypt, and heads to the front door. George dives out the back and comes around the side to meet them at the front. Samuel, looking to delay the men uses his poltergeist abilities to make the driver of the two horse taxi carriage that pulls up drop his reins, he then has to dismount to pick them up again. George walks up to the men, introduces himself and tries to persuade them to come inside the club, they aren't keen, he's assisted by Kyle back from grabbing the quill case, and sporting a huge cigar, he tries to get the men inside to check some paperwork and also disorient them with smoke from his huge cigar. But the two have not great success other than to delay the pair a few seconds. Sean joins the fray and tries to start a conversation with George. In desperation George tries to kick the wheel in an attempt to break it and prevent the carriage leaving, he fails and hurts his leg. Sean on the other hand tries to cut the reins holding one of the horses, he succeeds and as the carriage leaves it veers into the curb and pulls away slowly while veering all over the road, making it easy to follow. Sean ends up on the floor having been dragged a short distance while cutting the reins, George is hopping around holding his foot. Hubert shows up and George tasks him with following the coach in order to find it's eventual destination.

Checking the club records, our heroes find out that their names are Thurston Asbriar and Tobias Langford, and were introduced to the club by Harrington Frostbane. His address is on the forms and it's a house on the edge of London, in the direction of Kent. Kyle hits the books to see what he can find and comes up with bupkis. Sean asks Clerkonwell for help tracing the men and as it's late at night he tells Sean he'll try and have something for him by tomorrow lunchtime.

They head for their beds, well Samuel gets on with some light haunting and George does the rounds of his regular night time haunts (no pun intended) to try and be available for Silas to find him. Waiting around near Winchester Cathedral, George see a dark hooded figure heading towards him, his old friend Silas. They discuss events in the past and present. Silas tells George of the Ravenshade dagger that can kill any demon even if you don't have it's real name. The dagger was last seen in Lisbon a hundred years ago.

Hubert returns in the morning and tells George what he saw when he followed Gabriel to the church the previous evening and where the two gentlemen went. They headed to a house on the edge of London to pick up a man and then headed off to Kent. He can find the house again and believes the coaches eventual destination was the Frostholm mansion. He says he wasn't seen.

Sean consults a newspaper and see that Frostholm is up for a knighthood in the next investiture, for "Services to World Peace". Kyle suggests that Frostholm must have powerful friends, and that if the crew tries to steal the crown jewels that could be bad for them. There is a discussion that they only need disrupt part of the plan. George relays his conversation with Silas over breakfast and that thinks Silas will try to rally the vampires to work together to prevent Frostholm nabbing the alpha he needs. He wasn't hopeful though, vampires are not known to be collaborative creatures and this would require the clans working together. The team have a discussion about what to do next, they could go to the British Museum looking for the tablet or the knife.

Sean heads to see Clerkonwell, who tells him that the person who recommended Harrington to The Ambers Society doesn't actually know him and promises to make sure that none of the three will be allowed back into the building and will be struck off the club's list of members. After discussion, he'll also send agents to the Egypt expert, Sterlinghart's house to monitor suspicious activity.

They head off to the British Museum to speak to Isadora Featherstone, who the team remembers Kyle speaking about, but Kyle only remembers sleeping with another girl with the same surname. After a difficult meeting between Isadora and Kyle where she gets rightly annoyed by his "pretending" not to know her, Sean takes over. Sean speaks to Isadora, tells her he is writing about the mysteries of London and is looking for some content for future articles. The conversation swings around to the Ravenshade dagger and that it may have been sold years ago to Harrington Frostbane and that he lives at Harrington Hall on the outskirts of London. The team resolve to check it out.
