# The Mystery of Little Italy's Lost Children

*Being an Account of the Peculiar Adventures of Four Hunters in a Pocket Dimension, as Recorded for Posterity*

## Prologue: Return to the Ravaged Order
Our distinguished company of hunters, having faced trials most extraordinary in their recent encounters, resolved to return to the headquarters of the Order of the Veiled Dawn. Their purpose was most scholarly - to access the restricted archives in pursuit of arcane knowledge that might amalgamate their mystical dagger with the counterfeit tablet, forging a weapon capable of forestalling the approaching apocalypse.

Upon their arrival, the hunters surveyed a scene of considerable devastation. Gabriel West, ever observant of earthly comforts, noted with characteristic melancholy: "The bar is busted up. The top shelf is is not a top shelf any more. It's very much a bottom shelf of broken dreams and glasses." The establishment bore the savage marks of recent battle - the beautiful mahogany bar split asunder, its perfect shiny surface marred by what appeared to be the impact of many sharp objects. The once-proud Victorian armchairs of green leather lay mutilated, their springs and horsehair stuffing scattered like the entrails of some mechanical beast.

George Banks, Divine messenger though he was, took particular note of the destruction's nature. The wounds appeared not as clean sword cuts, but as the brutal impact marks of creatures smashing through furniture with primal violence - werewolves, perhaps, or men driven to bestial fury. The walls bore the testimonies of this conflict: claw marks, sword scores, and the pockmarks of errant bullets.

Sean, ever practical in his observations, remarked upon the makeshift arrangements the survivors had constructed - a damaged fireplace venting through windows, hot implements left ready in the flames for cauterizing wounds, and a communal pot of stew being distributed to the defending forces. The very domesticity of these arrangements spoke volumes about the siege's duration and intensity.

## The Fateful Book and the Vortex
Having received permission from Clerkonwell to access the restricted section - secured, as all proper libraries should be, with the smallest of keys attached to the tiniest of chains - the hunters began their research in earnest. The restricted volumes, bound in chains as befitted their dangerous knowledge, promised secrets that might aid their cause.

It was Kyle Nugget, that portly expert so devoted to bacon and his magnum pistol, who precipitated their extraordinary adventure. In pulling down a weighty tome, he inadvertently dislodged a second volume, which tumbled to the floor with fateful consequence. The book fell open to reveal, in gold filigree upon its cover, the outline of holly and ivy, and within its pages, the tantalizing phrase "Christmas Myths of Italy."

From this seemingly innocent text erupted a vortex of considerable power, drawing in the detritus of scholarship - pens, quills, and dust - before claiming the hunters themselves. All save Kyle, who by some quirk of fate remained behind as his companions were drawn into unconsciousness and thence into dimensions unknown.

## Arrival in the Realm of Saint Peter's
The hunters found themselves deposited most unceremoniously within a grand Catholic church, its Italian architecture unmistakable even to the untrained eye. But lo! What transformation had befallen Samuel Fitzwilliam in this crossing of dimensional boundaries! The ancient Elizabethan scholar, so long a ghostly presence, found himself possessed once more of corporeal form - solid, breathing, and subject to the mundane necessities of mortal flesh.

"I appear to be what's the word? What's the opposite of translucent? Opaque. I'm opaque. This is odd. I haven't been opaque for three hundred years," declared Samuel with characteristic bewilderment. His newfound corporeality brought with it the full catalog of mortal inconveniences - creaking joints, the need for relief, and the simple wonder of turning pages with actual fingers.

George Banks, recognizing the church as Catholic and Italian in tradition, served as their guide to ecclesiastical understanding. Gabriel West, battle-worn and bearing the marks of recent supernatural encounters, surveyed their situation with typical pragmatism.

## The Supplicant's Plea
Near the altar, they encountered Father Giuseppe, resplendent in proper priestly vestments, attending to a distraught Italian woman. Her cries echoed through the sacred space: "My daughter Maria has been she has been she's been taken. Help me, father. Help me." The woman, whom they would come to know as Mama Esposito, bore clothing that seemed somehow displaced in time - more suited to 1866 than their own 1896.

Sister Agnes, an English nun whose habit marked her as foreign to Italian tradition, stood witness to this maternal anguish. The priest, Father Giuseppe, revealed the date to be the fifth of January, 1866 - the traditional day when La Befana, the Italian witch, visits children to bestow gifts upon the worthy and coal upon the wicked. Sister Agnes showed a considerable lack of believe when she described La Befana as superstitious pagan nonsense and as asked to be more understanding by Father Giuseppe.

George Banks, moved by divine compassion and his angelic nature, attempted comfort in his imperfect Italian, while Gabriel offered the services of their company - men possessed of "a certain set of skills" that rendered them suitable for addressing supernatural difficulties.

## The Investigation Commences
The hunters accompanied Mama Esposito to her modest dwelling, where they examined the scene of the alleged supernatural crime. George Banks, drawing upon his celestial powers and aided by Gabriel's otherworldly abilities, cast a spell to observe the events of the previous night. As Gabriel entered a trance-like state, strange black tendrils emanated from his being, while George spoke in tongues of angelic provenance.

The vision revealed a figure matching traditional descriptions of La Befana - black-clad, carrying both broomstick and sack, moving with purpose through the night. Yet something seemed amiss in this tableau of folklore made manifest.

Sean, with his characteristic eye for detail and tendency toward beneficial stumbling, discovered coal dust mixed with what appeared to be petroleum jelly upon the windowsill - a substance that, when tested by Gabriel, proved readily flammable. This mixture was not the simple soot one might expect from a centuries-old witch traversing chimneys, but rather a modern concoction designed to simulate such authenticity.

## The Pattern Revealed
Their investigation led them to interview additional families, each bearing similar tales of nocturnal visitation and vanished children. The pattern became clear: children of precisely four or five years, taken one each night for three consecutive nights, all from the same small area of what they learned was Clerkenwell's "Little Italy."

Samuel Fitzwilliam, drawing upon his vast scholarly knowledge, noted the discrepancies in La Befana's alleged behaviour. As he observed with characteristic erudition: "This is, as I understand it, a bit like the naughty and nice Santa Claus, myth. They'll leave leave bad things for bad children and good things for good children, but not actually steal children, although they are witch like."

The consultation with Nonna Rossa, the ancient keeper of local lore, confirmed their suspicions. This wizened guardian of tradition immediately recognized the petroleum-coal mixture as artificial - a modern attempt to simulate the authentic soot that would naturally accumulate upon a genuine supernatural entity traversing chimneys across centuries.

## The Divine Intervention
When the hunters proposed gathering the remaining at-risk children into a single, protected location, they encountered the natural resistance of Italian parents to surrendering their young. It was here that George Banks revealed the true extent of his celestial nature, appearing to each family as a radiant angelic being - six-winged, golden-outlined, with eyes upon his wings and bearing his flaming sword in its full glory.

Speaking as Devithai, Keeper of Worlds, George proclaimed divine mandate: "God decrees your children must be kept safe... these people are to be trusted." The families, faced with such undeniable manifestation of heavenly authority, could do naught but acquiesce to this supernatural directive.

## The Night Watch
As midnight approached on the fourth night, the hunters took their positions. George ascended to the church bell tower, commanding a view of the surrounding streets. Gabriel, Samuel, and Sean stationed themselves in the homes of potential victims, armed with rudimentary flares for communication.

The long-awaited confrontation came to Sean's post. As the false La Befana entered through the door and prepared an exit of the window, Sean secreted the child away, leaving only empty bedding to confound the intruder. When the impostor discovered the deception and fled in panic, Sean's attempt at signalling went somewhat awry - his flare, intended to arc gracefully skyward, instead tumbled to create merely a loud bang in the street below.

## The Chase Through Clerkenwell
The pursuit that followed tested the limits of Samuel's newly-recovered corporeality. As he ruefully observed: "I'm a very old man. Not actually well, it's depending on how you measure age. But anyway, move it" George, utilizing his power of celestial transportation, attempted to gather his earthbound companion, though with results that landed them atop the church bell tower rather than at street level.

The fleeing figure, maintaining perfect disguise as the traditional Italian witch, led them inevitably toward Saint Peter's Church. Gabriel and Sean maintained pursuit while George and Samuel made their more circuitous descent from their elevated position.

## Revelations in Sacred Space
Within the church, Samuel demonstrated that his supernatural abilities remained intact despite his corporeal state. With magnificent poltergeist fury, he declared: "I am going to cause a mayhem of prayer books, hymn books, various anything, you know, sort of bits of paper, all sorts of other things, and poltergeist the fuck out of the situation." The resulting chaos of flying devotional materials served to halt the fleeing impostor.

Yet greater revelations awaited. A second figure appeared near the altar - another witch, but one bearing the authentic marks of centuries-old tradition. This newcomer spoke with a voice both quiet and powerful: "I am La Befana. What are you doing to the witch on the floor?"

## The Unmmasking
The confrontation reached its crescendo as the true La Befana demanded justice for the besmirching of her ancient reputation. George Banks, ever diplomatic despite wielding a flaming sword, negotiated between supernatural entities while Sean prepared to reveal the impostor's identity.

In proper tradition of such mysteries, the mask was torn away to reveal Sister Agnes, the English nun whose modern habits had seemed so out of place. Her confession poured forth: she had orchestrated the kidnappings to discredit pagan beliefs and drive the Italian community toward proper Christian faith.

"I wanted to try and get rid of this idea that the people have around here of of this pagan nonsense being, you know, something other than nonsense. They should believe in God, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, not this pagan rubbish," declared the unmasked deceiver.

## Divine Justice and Mercy
The true La Befana, ancient and terrible in her authentic power, seized the false witch with intent toward supernatural vengeance. Yet George Banks, embodying the highest virtues of his angelic nature, counselled mercy: "It is beneath you. Take vengeance, in doing so would besmirch your name further... We all deserve a chance of forgiveness, especially in the house of our lord."

The ancient Italian spirit, moved by such wisdom, released her captive to mortal justice. In gratitude for clearing her reputation, La Befana offered boons to the hunters. Sean, ever practical, requested assistance with their mystical tablets. The witch's ancient magic proved equal to the task, perfectly duplicating the sacred markings from the authentic tablet onto their counterfeit, creating the mystical fusion they had sought.

## The Return
With their mission accomplished and the children safely restored to their families (though this occurred largely off-stage, as such domestic reunions, while heartwarming, lack the dramatic weight suitable for our chronicle), La Befana opened once more the dimensional vortex. The hunters, clutching their now-perfected mystical artifacts, found themselves drawn back through the swirling void to the library of the Order of the Veiled Dawn.

Samuel Fitzwilliam, returned to his customary ghostly state, bore the experience with characteristic philosophical acceptance, though one suspects he retained fond memories of that brief time when food held taste and books possessed tangible pages.

## Epilogue: Justice Served
In the pocket dimension they left behind, justice took its proper course. Sister Agnes faced the full weight of Victorian law for child abduction, while Father Giuseppe's moral struggle between confession's sanctity and children's welfare was resolved. The families of Little Italy learned to distinguish between authentic folklore and criminal deception, and La Befana resumed her traditional Christmas duties with reputation restored.

The hunters, their tablet duplication problem solved, stood better prepared for the supernatural challenges that awaited them in their own reality.

# Questions for the Next Session
* Will Kyle Nugget ever forgive his companions for abandoning him in the library, or will he exact terrible bacon-scented revenge?
* Has Samuel retained any lingering effects from his brief return to corporeality, such as phantom hunger pangs or the urge to use lavatories?
* Will George's celestial revelations to Italian Catholic families create a religious schism in 1866 Little Italy, and if so, will he receive angry letters from the Vatican?
* Are there other pocket dimensions lurking in the Order's library?
* Will Gabriel's mysterious black tendrils and third eye abilities ever receive proper explanation, or will they remain conveniently vague for dramatic effect?
* Has Father Giuseppe learned to be more forthcoming about supernatural kidnappings, or will he continue prioritizing confession sanctity over child welfare?
* Will the real La Befana make a surprise appearance in the modern world, possibly armed with centuries of accumulated coal for particularly naughty supernatural creatures?
* Does anyone remember which is the original tablet?
