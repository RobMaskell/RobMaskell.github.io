# Kyle and the arches of destiny

December 17th 1896 - Late evening

Gabriel reaches out a glove clad hand to grab the Ravenshade Dagger, time slows, sounds distort, and the shadows stretch long. From the gloom, feathers fall like black snow. Emerging from the darkness is Azreal, a tall, androgynous figure draped in layers of ragged feathers and tattered funeral silk. Their face is half-hidden beneath a bird-skull mask

I am the Raven, I am Azreal, I am the passage to heaven for the worthy, I am the eyes and ears of god. You hold in your hand the dagger of endings, why do you think you are worthy to wield my dagger? 

The others find themselves not in the catacombs any more, but in a vast, unreal mirror chamber, it appears more like the idea of a room more than a room itself. The walls shimmer with rippling reflections, as if they are made of dark liquid glass. Each surface shows fragments of the hunters' memories, fears, and decisions, some true, others twisted.

Around the perimeter, elaborate mirror arches lead nowhere… or perhaps elsewhere. The ceiling is impossible to see; instead, it reflects the floor, creating the illusion of endless vertical space. The floor beneath them is smooth black obsidian, cracked slightly in places where hands made of bone and shadow press up from underneath, frozen just shy of breaking through. There are piles of skeletons in exactly the same places as they were in the original reliquary, as well as the bodies in the corner. They see Gabriel standing motionless, eyes glazed over with his hand on the dagger that appears here as it did in the reliquary.

They can see 6 identical mirrored arches. The mirror arches all have symbols scratched into the bones that make them up... `A Crow in Flight`, `A Chalice with an Engraved Skull`, `A Weeping Mask`, `A Closed Gate`, `An Empty Throne`, `An Open Gate`

Gabriel gives a feeble answer, it proves to be unacceptable, he is thrown away from the dagger back into the room to the mirror opposite, which is `Open Gate`, George decides to follow him through. There is a path made of trees that meet above the players, the trees appear to be made of moving tendrils of smoke. They find they can't go back only forward. George bamf's back to Kyle with Gabriel. They both feel significantly worse as they would have it they'd made their way along the path. They appear back in the mirrored arch room.

Sean enters the mirror of the `Weeping Mask` as he passes through the arch he's thinking of Samuel. Energy hits Samuel from all about, wreaths him in crackling light and lifts him up before dumping him to the ground, knocked out for a bit, but he comes around after a short while.

Gabriel having recovered from touching the dagger, heads through the `Crow in Flight`. He finds himself being chased by three skeletons, as he runs down the path he keeps coming to forks, sometimes the skeletons end up further away, other times then come closer depending on which fork he chooses. At one point he grabs his flame thrower and barbecues the skeletons in front of him when they get too close. Only for more to appear in the distance behind him at the next fork. Back in the arch room the skeletons there animate and start to attack the remaining party members. They are fighting off the skeletons when Gabriel appears out of the arch he went through and again uses his flame thrower to good effect until it runs out of fuel.

Kyle decides that based on the evidence he will try to take the dagger. He also meets an aspect of Azreal and it turns out that The Raven was the being Kyle had made his pact with and also the reason that Kyle is so good with a blade. He was the right choice.

George heads through the `Open Gate` and unlike the `Closed Gate` as he moves along the path he starts to feel better. After a time he walks out of the `Closed Gate` arch.

Kyle tries the `Empty Throne` arch. There when sitting on the throne he sees before him he meets another aspect of Azreal, and is shown a vision of the dagger being wielded in a previous final battle and after the person wielding it has triumphed. The aspect confirms the suspicions of the deal Kyle made being with The Raven.

Samuel heads through the last arch `Chalice with Skull`, as he heads through he is thinking of the Reliquary, and finds that as he walks down the path be appears through a portal into said reliquary. The some of the others follow, and they hear footsteps approaching. They also realise that they have come to where Samuel was thinking of as he walked through the portal. They make a snap decision to head back to the arch room and try again, this time the other portal appears in a stationary cupboard back at The Veiled Dawn HQ in The Ambers Society building. They walk out into the safety of headquarters.

## Questions
* Is Kyle now the leader of the group?
* Are there any downsides to the dagger apart from what Kyle was told by Azreal?
* What would have happened if anyone else had picked up the dagger without a glove?
* Will he tells the rest of the group?
* What now for our heroes?
