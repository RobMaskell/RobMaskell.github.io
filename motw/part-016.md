# House breaking is hell

On their way back from the British Museum Sean and Kyle discuss bringing joy to the sisters, one of which Kyle had just met for the first time. As they enter The Ambers Society building, they find Gabriel sitting in a high backed leather sipping a stiff drink. George summons his owl assistant Hubert, who drops that he'd followed Gabriel and there is a short discussion about why george felt that was necessary.

Sean procures train tickets as the fastest way to the Harrington House, Kyle is carrying Samuel's quill case. On arrival, standing outside the rather large two winged house like a group of house breaking burglars... they discuss how they will seek entry. The house looks darkish, but there is some light inside. Samuel floats off for a recce and finds at least two guards patrolling inside the house. Sean loudly considers setting fire to a bush in the front garden to act as a distraction, but finds that he doesn't have the votes, and also it's winter, damp and the bush has no leaves. Gabriel and George jump the wall down the side of the house level with the scullery door on the left side wall, Samuel floats around to the side too. The plan is for Sean, wearing a bowler hat, and Kyle, also wearing a bowler hat having been given one by Kyle, to knock on the front door and try to gain entry while distracting the guards. A plan of being carol singers is also discussed and put to one side. Samuel confirms that the guards look to be human.

Team front door, blag their way in saying that they have a message for Harrington Frostbane about the dagger and ask to speak with him. Not taking no for an answer they ask to wait inside and are shown to the kitchen. The kitchen of course being the next room to the scullery when team side door are trying to make a quiet entrance.

While team back door are working their way through the locked scullery door, team front door are trying to get clear of the kitchen by just wandering into the hall. It all gets a bit tense and in the end the one of the the guards is killed by Sean, the other is distracted by Kyle and cold cocked by the arriving Gabriel. He's tied up and stashed in a front room.

The teams reunite and search the rest of the house as much as they can. During the search they find a small staircase and leads down into a passage. Kyle elects to stay topside, stationing himself in the kitchen, while the others head down into the black. They are looking for a smaller than usual dagger, with a black blade made of obsidian.

The passages beneath Harrington Hall are stone-hewn corridors, meticulously carved and reinforced with aged brickwork and arched masonry. The walls are slick with damp and veined with mineral stains, their surfaces marked by old chiselling and layered grime from centuries of disuse. Overhead, vaulted ceilings stretch into shadow, often adorned with crumbling stone ribs or gothic flourishes. Moisture seeps through fine cracks, and in places, hair-thin roots dangle from above, having pierced through from the gardens or ancient trees above. The effect is both natural and surrealâ€”like the earth is slowly reclaiming the corridors.

Every breath of air is cool and dry, but tinged with a musty scent of decay, dust, and ancient incense. Distant echoes often return distorted, and unseen draft currents suggest there are deeper chambers still unexplored.

The first room hewn out of the ground is a meeting room with old chairs and a lectern. There are passageways to the left and right, The sound of chains can be heard coming from the left hand passage. At the end of the passage is a wrought iron gate, looking through the plucky crew can see what looks like a library and occult store room, there is a figure chained to the wall on one side opposite the shelves of books and interesting objects. Samuel floats on for a look around but doesn't see anything more than can be spotted from the door. One of our heroes unlocks the gate and they head in. George crouches over the figure, who turns out to be a vampire prisoner. They are in the middle of asking him if he's an alpha when the sound of growling can be heard from across the room.

In the dark our group had not spotted the small tunnel entrance, between two book shelves. A hell hound, invisible to all but Samuel comes careering out of the entrance heading straight for George and the vamp. Quick thinking by Samuel as he uses his poltergeist powers to throw books at the monster, causing the book dust to rest on it making the outline at least visible to everyone. The hell hound heads for George, growling and scratching its way across the flagstone floor and they start fighting. George takes a minor wound but the hound comes off worse but still very much alive. Sean and Gabriel quickly made there way to the gate when the hound arrived and now Sean attempts to shoot it with his hunting rifle, using the crouching Gabriel as a perch for the barrel. The Hound is further wounded, but the shots sound out and ring Gabriel's head like a bell disorienting him for a few minutes.

As the hound runs at the other two, George manages to slash the tendons in it's back legs, Sean grabs the shotgun from Gabriel, who is still stunned, and gives the hell hound both barrels to the face, while Gabriel's flame thrower ignites the dust on the hell hound and it finally dies.

## Questions
* Will Gabriel and George ever bury the hatchet?
* Will Sean ever get to set fire to a burning bush?
* When did killing civilians become ok?
* Will they find the dagger, before more hell hounds find them?
* That new vamp... what's his whole deal?
* Will they get to rob the place or will they get discovered?
* What other monsters await them in the basement this week?
