# Being an account of multiple messes in Maida Vale

December 20th 1896 - Around Midnight

*Being a most comprehensive account of events transpiring on the twentieth day of December, in the year of our Lord eighteen ninety-six, wherein our intrepid band of supernatural investigators found themselves most grievously separated and imperilled.*

## The Division of Forces
As the winter night deepened beyond the witching hour, our company found themselves pursuing divergent paths in their quest to thwart the machinations of the treacherous C-12 and his confederates within the Foundation. The angelic George Banks, having received divine missive from the Archangel Michael himself, was compelled to seek out their missing comrade Gabriel West, whilst the others followed the trail left by Joshua Barker's curious business card.
Samuel Fitzwilliam, that most ancient of scholarly spirits, had prudently retreated to his quill case sanctuary, declaring with characteristic wit: "Why would you tell people useful information? That would be foolish." His ethereal wisdom proving most prescient, as events would shortly demonstrate.

## Gabriel's Unfortunate Predicament
Our Foundation operative Gabriel West, having pursued the coded messages left by his contact Novilium Black through the parks and coaching inns of London, found himself ensnared in what can only be described as a most elaborate trap. Following the trail to a townhouse in Maida Vale, the poor fellow's reconnaissance was cut short when his attempt at stealth went most catastrophically awry.

Armed with his shotgun and burning with righteous fury, Gabriel attempted to subdue one of the Foundation turncoats with what he optimistically termed "a headlock with shotgun leverage." Alas, even his supernatural bottle-it-up abilities could not compensate for the ambitious nature of such a manoeuvre, resulting in his thorough defeat and subsequent captivity.

Upon awakening some hours later, Gabriel found himself bound to a bed in what appeared to be the secure room of a Foundation safe house, with none other than Novilium Black similarly restrained nearby. Black revealed the grim truth: C-12's rebellion had gathered far more support than anticipated, with perhaps ten or more agents now actively working against the proper order of things.

"The time for talking is finished, and the time for arresting is finished as well," Black declared, as Gabriel began the arduous process of freeing himself through what can only be described as methodical self-mutilation of his digits.

## The Goat Public House Gambit
Meanwhile, George's telephonic investigation of the Barker household had yielded fruit most unexpected. Through discourse with the elder Mrs. Barker, he learned that young Joshua had departed for "The Goat" public house in Maida Vale some days prior. This intelligence prompted our heroes to venture forth in their purloined steampunk carriage, bearing both the genuine Tablet of the Dead and its soon to be cunningly crafted duplicate.

The establishment proved most peculiar for the late hour - populated entirely by well-dressed gentlemen engaged in games of chance, their conversation peppered with references to "the Foundation" and queries about "picking the right side." Samuel's reconnaissance of the upper floors revealed room three to be currently empty, though recently occupied, whilst George employed his divine lock-picking abilities to investigate further.

Kyle Nugget, that corpulent master of bacon and blades, descended to engage the card players in their game of five-card stud, demonstrating once again his remarkable facility for both winning hands and consuming whisky. His strategic distraction allowed George to proceed with more vigorous interrogation methods upstairs.

## Enhanced Interrogation and Family Revelations
George's investigation took a decidedly darker turn when confronted by one of the Foundation agents in room three. Drawing upon methods that, whilst perhaps not explicitly forbidden by the Ten Commandments, certainly tested the boundaries of angelic conduct, he subjected his captive to what modern sensibilities might term "waterboarding."
"I have been around a long time and learned many things that you humans don't enjoy. And I believe one of them is drowning," George announced with chilling precision, his glowing eyes no doubt adding considerable emphasis to his theological argument.

The enhanced interrogation yielded an address: 26 Maida Vale Street, though the prisoner's Foundation training prevented him from revealing more tactical intelligence before George rendered him unconscious.

Simultaneously, Kyle's gambling success took an unexpected personal turn when he discovered among his opponents none other than Pablo - the brother of his estranged wife. This revelation, accompanied by Kyle's use of luck to avoid immediate violence, provided both tactical advantage and considerable emotional complexity.

"You know we call you fuck nugget," Pablo declared, to which Kyle responded with characteristic aplomb: "That's simply not true. I have never had sex with someone with no arms and legs."

## Escalating Tensions and Divine Intervention
As events reached their crescendo, George's heavenly foresight manifested in a crucial moment of divine intervention. Sensing Kyle's impending peril through supernatural means, he dispatched Samuel to warn: "Kyle, you're about to get into fights. Don't. It will end badly for you."

This celestial guidance proved most fortuitous, as Kyle's situation had indeed deteriorated rapidly. His shooting of Pablo in the foot, whilst initially effective for crowd control, had precipitated a general uprising among the Foundation agents. Only through George's retrospective divine warning was wholesale violence temporarily averted.

The session concluded with our heroes in most precarious circumstances: Gabriel and Black preparing their desperate gambit in the Foundation safe house, whilst George and Kyle found themselves trapped on the upper landing of The Goat, surrounded by hostile agents both above and below.

# Questions for the Next Chronicle
* Will Gabriel's glass-embedded fist fighting technique prove more effective than his previous shotgun gambits?
* Can George maintain his angelic status after engaging in what heaven's HR department might term "aggressive interrogation methods"?
* Will Kyle's family reunion with Pablo end in reconciliation, gunfire, or perhaps both simultaneously?
* Does Samuel's increasing difficulty with wall-penetration indicate supernatural interference, or merely the Victorian equivalent of network connectivity issues?
* Will Sean finally contribute something meaningful to the group dynamic, or continue his illustrious career as a human tablet cushion? (Only talking about this session)
* Can our heroes rescue Gabriel before he transforms completely into a Victorian-era John McCain?
* Will the two Tablets of the Dead remain secure under the watchful protection of an unconscious man and a incorporeal scholar?
* Is The Goat's publican secretly in league with the Foundation, or merely an opportunistic capitalist taking advantage of armed men with gambling problems?

*Thus concludes this most eventful chronicle, with our heroes scattered across Maida Vale, their fates hanging in the balance like so many dice cast upon fortune's table.*
