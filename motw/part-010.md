# Angels and Demons

George walks out of the pub, and something appears disrectly behind him, smacks him on the back of the head, knocking him out, and they both disappear. Quick work between Sean and Samuel means they can work out that the apparition was a demon and that George has likely been snatched.

The motely crew discuss moving on without him, especially Gabriel who thinks there are some forms to be filled in back at the Veiled Dawn. In the end they decide on recovery. Samuel casts a spell using George's spare hip flask to try and locate him. Tendrils of his ghsotly essence head off in all directions and return to form a ghostly scene of a gate house on a road. After a short dicsussion it's assumed this is the Appledore gate house.

Gabriel heads off to speak with the two foundation operartives, Edmund Ashcombe who he knows and has worked with before and a fairly new operative Barty Treadwell. They chat whilst maintaining a cover of Gabriel asking for a light. Edmund tells Gabriels he's been sent to follow him and even though he knows Gabriel is good people will have to do his job. He also says he is worried by what is going on back at HQ.

Reunited (minus George) they ask a small boy, selling rolls, for directions to Appledore while buying 3 rolls. Tensions between the driver and Gabriel rise further when the driver realises he's been left out (again).

Hitting the road they pull up the carriage half a mile before their destination and decide to walk the rest of the way, staying off the road by walking in the field on the other side of the hedge. The driver stays behind to turn the carriage around and attempt to camoflage it a little. Samuel scouts ahead at the end of his 200 foot ghostly leash.

The scene switches to George, trapped in a pentagram, upstairs in a building somewhere. The pentagram has additional symbols and is drawn in a white powder. There are four men in the room and some witty barbs are exchanged betwee them and their prisoner. Meanwhile George tries to see if he can bamf away, he can't, and then disrupt the circle somehow to escape. He tries to move the white powder but can't affect it from inside the circle. He doesn't try any magic to disrupt it from outside.

As they get closer to the building Samuel is able to communicate with George and a plan is hatched to storm the building. Sean will climb a tree and provide cover for the operation. Kyle is keen to use his magnum, Gabriel will do most anything to be first through the door after spotting that there is an extra backdoor on the other side of the tower to the road. Samuel will provide a ghostly distraction to the guard they can see while Kyle laying in wait (weight?) will jump out and kill him. This scheme initially mostly goes to plan, but as the guard is cut by Kyle's expertly weilded knife, his eyes go black and a trail of black smoke comes out of his mouth and heads off in the supposed direction of the big house. Demon! Kyle then has to deal with the fact that he has probably killed an innocent! His body is dragged to the hedge to hide the evidence.

In the confusion of dealing with the guard Gabriel has made it to the door of the two storey tower. Heading through the door, shotgun first, Gabriel finds himself face to face with another guard, maybe human, maybe another demon he doesn't know. They come at each other, Gabriel opens fire with a salt round from the shotgun hitting the guard, but making lots of noise. The guard goes down, blood and salt everywhere across his chest, the demon posessing him smokes out and also appears to be heading for the house.

Two of the guards upstairs come down to see what the commotion is about. Sean tries to pick one off from his snipers nest in the tree, George opens fire on the other one. Kyle and Samuel have caught up at this point and try to get involved. Kyle bundles through the door and opens fire with the magnum, Samuel tries to follow but quickly realises he's at the end of his ghostly tether because Sean has his quill case.

There is much shooting, some missing, and an extremely lucky shot by Sean that takes out one of the goons. Meanwhile Samuel who can just about get his head in the building tries to use magic to disrupt the circle upstairs holding George. He alomst manages but not quite enough to free his friend.

The remaining goon downstairs takes Gabriel, his gun now empty, and holds a knife to his throat, trying to get Kyle to put his trusty magnum down. Kyles considers shooting anyway, Gabriel acceptes his fate.

At this point all the guns are snatched from hands and sent ceiling-wards...

## Questions
* Demons, where the hell did they come from?
* If there is an angel trap sigil does that mean there is a demon version?
* Is killing innocents ok, were they dead anyway?
* What will Sean find is happening now that is related to something that happened years ago?
* Who snatched the guns at the end?
