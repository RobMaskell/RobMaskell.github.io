It's the morning of the day after the theatre escapade and Gabriel, sitting in the loungue of the Ambers Society, gets a telegram "Your god-daughter has fallen ill. Please attend urgently". He spurns the offered help from Sean and George and after making his excuses to Clerkonwell he heads off into the London morning. The other we know head off to deal with the issue at the docks but what happened to Gabriel... He takes a coach to the nonedescript headquarters of The Foundation. After getting through the coded lock on the inner door, he walks past the steampunk vacuum tubes and heads on up to the office of his handler C12 and walks directly in. Pleasantries exchanged they get down to it. C12 pumps Gabriel for more information and doesn't get any. He also tells Gabriel that he needs to leave Octavian Frostholm alone and that this order come directly down from Novilium Black the head of The Foundation. It's pointed out to Gabriel that failing to comply could be a career limiting move. Gabriel says that he understands and hangs around for a while to cover the time he would have been visting the sick child.

Next morning, after pancakes and eggs for breakfast, our cut down crew of Gabriel and Sean reconvene around George who has taken up his usual seat next to a whisky in the lounge. They bring Gabriel up to speed on the events at the docks, the saving of Percival and the discovery of the "Litania Nihilis Atrorum" from the Principia Magica. Information that extracted from the werewolf they also saved and let go. The plan is to go down and see Percival, George requests a glass of special whisky to cheer Percival up, it's fetched by the staff. He promptly drinks it.

Percival tells them that he saw the building up of guards at the warehouse on the docks, and that he saw many comings and going one of which was a large person sixed box. He talks about the octi=opus goop on his clotes at which point Gabriel surreptitiously takes a sample. Sean uses he canny knack of finding clues and discovers a coach ticket to Kent in the mans pocket which seemd to come from the werewolf somehow. Dr Hathaway comes in at that point and a discussion takes place about how they all need to leave and how much better Percival would be with a nice whisky.

A quick pitstop is taken to visit the Veiled Dawn's library, the librarian Gideon Emberwynd doesn't have a copy of the Principia but promises to make enquiries.

The three men head off to the offices of The Times to see Vanessa Waverly, after a pretty cagey conversation where neither side really wants to give anything important away, the gand get some info about Octavian, that he comes from shady money, has a bit pile down in Kent. They also swap contact info. Gabriel takes the opportuniy to drop some paper on the floor for Vanessa, which was the form from earlier signed by George...

## Questions
* Where is the mansion in Kent?  
* Where is the Principia?  
* How many copies exist and does Octavian already have one?  
* What will Vanessa do with the form?  
* What will Gabriel do about the Foundation?  
* Can he trust anything he gets from them anymore?
