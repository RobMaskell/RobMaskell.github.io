# Kent the Garden of England

December 12th 1896 - Afternoon

During a group discussion, Gabriel asks Kyle if he can get into the library and see if they have the tablet. Kyle is sitting reading a big book that has a naughty magazine in the middle.

It's decided to seek out an Egyptologist and Gideon is given the job of making discrete enquiries and will get back to them, either in person or with a note.

Gabriel heads out to find a shady jeweller, he comes across a black and gold shopfront down a thin dark alley. It has a wooden sign that reads, "Doyles and Sons" through the somewhat grimy windows a few necklaces can be seen.

The proprietor Priscilla Wildewood greets Gabriel and they chat. They discuss sourcing a large diamond ostensibly for an engagement ring. The Crown jewels and sceptre are discussed. Priscilla can't get anything that big but will investigate if a fake could be made. The queen uses the crown jewels on state occasions, weddings, funerals, investitures and state opening of parliament.

Back at the Ambers Society, a couple of new members are being shown around by the Ambers staff. A letter is hand delivered for Gabriel.

George goes to speak with Clerkonwell about the Egyptian Tablet of the Dead and whether he can get a tab paid for the upcoming trip to kent.

Kyle finds an article about Lord Reginald Sterlinghart who has recently returned from Egypt with a shipment of archaeological artefacts he has spend his time collecting. They will of course be stored at his stately home. He is looked up in "Who's Who" to find out where the family estate is.

Gabriel returns and opens his letter, it's not what he expected...

"The letter is from C12, thanking you for the update, and answering your question by saying that the Foundation response is under discussion internally and can't be discussed over normal mail... basically the big fob off of "It's confidential / above your pay grade". It also suggests that Foundation eyes are on you and to remember our previous conversation on the matter... Regards C12"

Kyle on the other hand sends a letter off to Lord Sterlinghart...

```
To the Esteemed Lord Reginald Sterlinghart,

My Lord,

I trust this letter finds you in good health and that your most recent foray into the sands of Egypt left neither scar nor curse upon your noble personage. Rumours of your triumphant unearthing of that peculiar jackal-headed statuette have reached even my hermitage, and I must confess, I am most intrigued though the idea of accompanying you on such an endeavour leaves me breathless (as does most activity).

I write, dear Reginald, not merely to bask in your archaeological glow but to extend a most cordial invitation to The Amber Society's next gathering, where your presence would be hailed as a veritable triumph. The date <insert reasonable date here>, promises to be neither so soon as to inconvenience you nor so distant as to lose its charm. I assure you, it is no mean soir√©e, though I admit, it occasionally devolves into a cavalcade of eccentricities present company included, of course.

The Society is positively ravenous for tales of your adventures and the treasures you have liberated (for educational purposes, naturally) from their sandy slumber. We would hang upon your every word with the rapt attention of a Pharaoh's court though, unlike them, we shan't require gold leaf or incantations to ensure compliance.

I shall expect you to dazzle us with anecdotes, educate us with your profound insights, and, if the mood strikes, perhaps terrify us with warnings of long-dead curses. Do bring that jackal-headed wonder, should it be willing to part with its perch for the evening. If it refuses, I shan't take offence; I am told even artifacts have moods these days.

Kindly send word of your acceptance, unless, of course, you have been spirited away by some spectral guardian of the underworld. In which case, I shall take your silence as both an apology and an excuse to embellish your exploits most scandalously.

Yours most indolently,

Kyle Nuget

It is decided that someone should speak to the reporter again about leaks of the New Years Honours list to see if Octavian is included, in case he would be at the investiture along with the Queen and the jewels.

They take Gabriel's large 4 horse golden painted carriage, overnight, to Ashford in Kent. During the night George orbs back to London to leave a note at a known vampire hangout (pun intended) to try and contact his old friend Sirus Runcorn for information.

December 13th 1896 - Early morning

In the morning they arrive at the Ashford coaching inn to refresh the horses and look for information. They speak to the landlord of The Three Barrels, who confirms that Oxley is known for the supernatural and that a famous person, Thaddeus Ironlock, will be giving a talk there in a day or so.

They travel onto Oxley, as they arrive there are normal inhabitants of the village and also some more interesting and well dressed men and women walking around. They must be the visitors the landlord has spoken of. A street cleaner is giving the rich people side-eye. The village is much greener than London, a bowling green can be seen, also an inn, it has Tudor vibes. There is discussion about looking for other ghosts. They also see a steampunk looking carriage with aerials on the roof and piping around the outside.

In one part of the smallish village there is a gazebo that looks like the site of the talk, currently a band is playing and people are sat on hay bales listening to the music.

A school house and church hall can also be seen. It seems that Appledore sponsor the schoolhouse and the family logo of a snake eating it's own tail wrapped around and apple can be seen emblazoned on it.

Kyle and Gabriel head to The Spectre, the local inn, the innkeeper is persuaded by Kyle to toss out some paying guests such that two rooms can be made available for them, it will be done if they come back in a few hours.

Sean and George head to St Marys church to interview the priest. As they are discussing ghosts and the Frostholm family at Appledore, two men enter with what looks like a steampunk style detector and they head towards the group. It turns out to be a ghost detector and they are picking up a signal from Samuels quill case. 

George creates a distraction while Sean exits the church through a side door. George makes a grab for the device from one of them after it's clear discussion isn't going to resolve the matter and that they think they have found a ghost. He knocks the guy over and his ankle is sprained, he stays down clutching it.

Outside the church the fighting continues between Sean, George and the last of the ghost hunters. Gabriel and Kyle now out of the inn see the commotion and head over to help out. Gabriel gets there first and throws himself into the fight. After the fight the last guy hobbles off supported by George.

Gabriel sees a couple of guys in sharp suits hanging around the village square, they make a symbolic gesture that flags them up as Foundation members and Gabriel responds in kind with a secret response signal....
