# PbtA EP Conversion (EP1) vs Uncharted EP Conversion (EP2)

## General Comments

EP1 lines up better with the original Apocalypse World and is clearly based on it, whereas as Ben suggests EP2 is based on Uncharted World which is a Star Trek style space opera game from the look of it and the toons are somewhat limited by that in gear and such

## Specific comparisons

| Thing to be compared | EP1 | EP2 |
| :-- | :-- | :--|
| Core Concepts - Rolling| Has roll modifiers like `:glitched` or `:boosted` **PREFER** | Has extra Advantage / Disadvantage rules I can't decide about, no modifiers |
| Core Concepts - Hold | Is a thing  **PREFER** | Not a thing |
| Core Concepts - Dmg | Ladder, similar to AW **PREFER** | This I don't like, gets big quick |
| Core Concepts - Data points | Doesn't exist | I quite like this idea **PREFER** |
| Basic Moves | Access the Mesh, Aid/Hinder, Assess the Situation, Negotiate, Open Fire, Procure Something, Skirmish, Take a Chance, Integration, Alienation, and Continuity, Damage Move, Trauma Move **PREFER???** | Assessment, Face Adversity, Get Involved, Access, Command, Launch Assault, Open Fire, Patch Up, Take Damage, Take Trauma, Acquisition **PREFER???** |
| Advancement | Individual to the player based on marking XP if roll a 6- **PREFER** | Collective, everyone marks XP if anyone hits a chosen trigger, that can only be used once per toon. `Might be more equal?` |
Charcter stats choice | Stats must equal 5, means very weird builds possible | I +2 / +2 / +1 / +0 / -1 spread out **PREFER**|
| Background | One move out of 2 for my choice, but more open for others e.g. 'and tech move' for Infolife | 1 moves out of 4 |
| Faction | your faction, and your relationship to it, impacts when and among whom your procure something rolls are `+boosted` or `+glitched`. Also two character moves from the big list, very free choice| Choose 2 moves from 6, + advancement triggers **PREFER (but might need this games gear system)** |
| Morph (What you get very similar in add-ons) | Free choice, doesn't seem to be a cost but includes toys, could be misused | Part of asset system better morphs have cost from your asset allowance. Plus... Upgrades: Pick 2 upgrades when designing Class 1 Morph, pick 4 for Class 2, etc. **SLIGHTLY PREFER ON BALANCE**|
| Gear | Most basic gear is cheap to the point of being free. The only restricted items tend to be dangerous or require exotic raw materials. As a result, characters can start with pretty much any personal effects they desire. In addition, each character may start with four items or services that might otherwise be expensive or difficult to obtain. Then for extras currency is rep or resources, both can get dimished if overused  | At character creation, choose two Class 1 Assets and one Class 2 Asset. Choose as many Class 0 Assets as is reasonable to fill out your character. Mophs and weapons count as assets. Class 0 - simple, Class 1 - Rarer, Class 2 - rare, advanced, Class 3 - exceptionally rare, Class 4 - ??????. Your Resource Asset's Class is used when rolling the Acquisition move (Rep, Fame basedcan become depleted or roll at disavantage if no or bad rep) |
| Persona | Both have the answer questions for a free advance | Both have the answer questions for a free advance |
| Other thoughts... |  | +Medichines are awesome... You have custom medical technology in your body. Automatically heal minor and major wounds |
