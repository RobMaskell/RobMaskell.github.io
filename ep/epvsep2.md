# PbtA EP Conversion (EP1) vs Uncharted EP Conversion (EP2)

## General Comments

EP1 lines up better with the original Apocalypse World and is clearly based on it, whereas as Ben suggests EP2 is based on Uncharted World which is a Star Trek style space opera game from the look of it and the toons are somewhat limited by that in gear and such

## Specific comparisons

| Thing to be compared | EP1 | EP2 |
| :-- | :-- | :--|
| Core Concepts - Rolling| Has roll modifiers like `:glitched` or `:boosted` **PREFER** | Has extra Advantage / Disadvantage rules I can't decide about, no modifiers |
| Core Concepts - Hold | Is a thing  **PREFER** | Not a thing |
| Core Concepts - Dmg | Ladder, similar to AW **PREFER** | This I don't like, gets big quick |
| Core Concepts - Data points | Doesn't exist | I quite like this idea **PREFER** |
| Basic Moves | Access the Mesh, Aid/Hinder, Assess the Situation, Negotiate, Open Fire, Procure Something, Skirmish, Take a Chance, Integration, Alienation, and Continuity, Damage Move, Trauma Move **PREFER???** | Assessment, Face Adversity, Get Involved, Access, Command, Launch Assault, Open Fire, Patch Up, Take Damage, Take Trauma, Acquisition **PREFER???** |
| Advancement | Individual to the player based on marking XP if roll a 6- **PREFER** | Collective, everyone marks XP if anyone hits a chosen trigger, that can only be used once per toon. `Might be more equal?` |
Charcter stats choice | Stats must equal 5, means very weird builds possible | I +2 / +2 / +1 / +0 / -1 spread out **PREFER**|
| Background | One move out of 2 for my choice, but more open for others e.g. 'and tech move' for Infolife | 1 moves out of 4 |
| Faction | your faction, and your relationship to it, impacts when and among whom your procure something rolls are `+boosted` or `+glitched`. Also two character moves from the big list, very free choice| Choose 2 moves from 6, + advancement triggers **PREFER (but might need this games gear system)** |
| Morph | Free choice, doesn't seem to be a cost | Part of asset system better morphs have cost from your asset allowance **SLIGHTLY PREFER ON BALANCE**|
